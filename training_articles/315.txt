SYDNEY (MarketWatch) — Crude oil futures slipped in electronic trading Wednesday ahead of a closely-watched weekly U.S. supply report.
Crude for June delivery/quotes/zigman/2203144CLM2-0.24%lost 24 cents, or 0.2%, to $105.92 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange during Asian trading hours.
After Monday's release of the Chicago Business Barometer fell short of expectations, focus fell on Tuesday's manufacturing report.
The losses followed a 1.2% gain made in the North American trading session Tuesday, after an upbeat U.S. manufacturing report buoyed investor confidence in the economic recovery.Read more on U.S. manufacturing.
Manufacturing activity in China also improved last month, but remained below the level separating expansion from contraction, the final reading of a monthly survey by HSBC released Wednesday showed.
The result comes one day after official data revealed a slight pick-up in activity at Chinese factories.Read more on China's HSBC April PMI.
Crude investors were also evaluating a supply report issued by the American Petroleum Institute (API) late Tuesday showing crude-oil inventories rose 2.04 million barrels on the week ended April 27.
The API report comes ahead of the more closely-watched official data from the Department of Energy, due on Wednesday.
Analysts polled by Platts expect crude inventories to rise 2.5 million barrels, gasoline stockpiles down 1 million barrels, and inventories of distillates down 400,000 barrels.
