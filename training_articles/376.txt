Apr 29, 2012 -TheLos Angeles Lakers, the Pacific Division champions and No. 3 seed in the Western Conference, square off against theDenver Nuggetsin one of the most intriguing matchups of the first round.Metta World Peaceis suspended for the first six games of this series for his elbow toJames Harden'shead, which probably has contributed to the fact that the Nuggetsare slightly favoredbefore the series begins.
The key for the Lakers will be managing their lack of depth. AsKobe Bryantcontinues to try to work his way back to full strength from a shin injury and with World Peace out of the lineup for likely all of this series, head coachMike Brownhas to figure out a way to prevent guys likeDevin Ebanks,Andrew Goudelock,Troy MurphyandJosh McRobertsfrom playing in key stretches, especially at the same time. If Brown can manage those minutes effectively, the Lakers should be fine.
As crazy as this would have sounded a few months ago when he was championing the league's avant-garde art project known as the early-seasonWashington Wizards,JaVale McGeecould be the key in this series. Facing the likes ofPau GasolandAndrew Bynum, McGee's potential ability to control the paint defensively and contribute on offense could sway the series, whileTy LawsonandKenneth Fariedprovide fast-break energy the Lakers have never shown the ability to match, even with trade-deadline acquisitionRamon Sessions.
Game Date/Time: Sunday, April 29, 3:30 p.m. ET
Location: Staples Center, Los Angeles
TV: ABC
