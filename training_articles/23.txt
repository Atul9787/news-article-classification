A Norse god, aWorld War IIveteran, a modern defense contractor and the green-skinned star of a 1970s television series -- that's a lot of superheroes to pack into one movie. More important, that's a lot of fanboys to please.
Luckily, writer-director JossWhedonis one -- a fanboy, that is, though he also does a superheroic job of compressing several summer blockbusters into "Marvel's The Avengers," a splashy, flashy, pass-the-popcorn extravaganza. This is a movie that knows and deeply loves its audience, but it's funny, smart and good-natured enough to please the rest of us, too.
With its classically hokey plot involving an alien army and a power cube called the Tesseract (Zak Penn, of Syfy's "Alphas," co-wrote), "The Avengers" isn't trying to break new ground. The payoff is watching four appealing actors don their costumes and have fun with each other, and Whedon gives you nearly 2 1/2 hours' worth.Robert Downey Jr.'sIron Manrules the roost with his one-liners;Chris Evansshines as his polar opposite, the earnestCaptain America; Chris Hemsworth, asThor, roars his Beowulfian lines with good humor; andMark Ruffalomakes a nerve-rackingBruce Banner, though his crude Claymation transformation into theHulkis a disappointment compared to the film's other kabillion-dollar effects.
Scarlett Johansson's slippery Black Widow is a more engaging newcomer thanJeremy Renner's humorless Hawkeye, whileSamuel L. JacksonandClark Greggreturn in dependably fine form as team leader Nick Fury and his lovable mascot, Phil Coulson. The secret scene-stealer, though, is Tom Hiddleston as the power-mad Loki, deftly switching between Shakespearean intensity and the flippant pop humor that gives "The Avengers" the light sparkle of an ensemble comedy.
That easy, breezy attitude, and Whedon's snappy direction (which livens up overly familiar sequences like the Manhattan-wreckingfinale), are what make "The Avengers" such a crowd-pleaser. A hermetically sealed comics collection might be helpful, but not required.
