Oh, thank goodness!!
Though we don't fear change, there's a certain air of class about theKodakDolby Theatre that stadiums can't match!
And since theAcademy Awardsceremony is the most elegant of the season, we're SO happy to share the good news!!
Though the name has changed to Dolby, that golden theatre at Hollywood & Highland will remain Oscar's home for at least 21 more years.  An arbitrary number… but yay!!
Academy presidentTom Sherakis elated, saying:
The Academy's board of governors believes that the home for our awards is in Hollywood; it is where the Academy and the motion picture industry are rooted. We are pleased to have a new agreement with CIM (the company that owns the H&H complex) that will continue our long-standing partnership. We wanted to be in Hollywood. The Academy Awards belong in Hollywood. Dolby is a proud industry name.
This is GREAT for tourism too!!
Since so many tourists flock to Hollywood Blvd, they can tour the placeAngelina Joliespread her leg AND hop on a Haunted Hollywood tour in the same day!!!
Sigh… gotta love themagicof Tinsel Town, LOL!!
