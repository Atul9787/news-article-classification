I knew it—knew it, knew it, knew it,knew it. Iknewthe Nuggets were going to get their asses handed to them by the Los Angeles Lakers on Sunday afternoon. I knew it because I have come to terms with what it has meant to be a Nuggets fan in the 2000s, no matter how much this team was sold to us as “different.” It might be Danilo Gallinari, Kenneth Faried, and Andre Miller instead of Carmelo Anthony, Nene, and... Andre Miller, but no matter what you tell me, the eye test says this is the exact same Nuggets we used to have.
The last few months in the life of a Nuggets fan were odd ones. It was a series of stretches where Denver looked dominating: Stringing together a series of wins with prolific scoring, ferocious rebounding, and blinding speed. But every time you’d start to think there was reliable quality in the cards, the Nuggets would crap out against a bad team or get destroyed by a good one, whichever happened to be the most demoralizing at the time. Then you’d swear off expectations for the team, and right away, it would reel off a handful of wins and the train would get a-rollin’ once again. On April 13, the Nuggets broke a two-game winning streak in a frustrating loss to the Lakers, where their typical shortcomings were on display: Kobe Bryant was out, and yet the Nuggets still made somebody unremarkable (Matt Barnes) look good and somebody good (Andrew Bynum) look superhuman.
It was then that I made a personal pact to not let the Nuggets suck me in again. I said it right there, all but swearing a blood oath: No matter what the Nuggets did the rest of the regular season, I wasn’t going to get amped for the playoffs. Last year I was amped, and last year the Nuggets got beaten in a wild series with budding division rival Oklahoma City. I’m not one for lashes of anger for sports struggles, but the series with the Thunder last year not only stoked a burning hatred for OKC’s squad, but damn near broke my hand when I punched a counter in frustration. I was determined to not let that happen this year. Denver destroyed Houston in a home and home and I said, “Nope.” Denver handled the Suns in Phoenix, a place they never win; I said, “Nope.” Denver demolished playoff-bound Orlando by 37, beat the Thunder in Oklahoma, and destroyed punchy division opponent Minnesota in the season finale. I didn’t budge.
Oklahoma City scored an ostensibly thrilling last-second comeback over defending champion Dallas on Saturday night, and I couldn’t enjoy it—not only did I hate the Thunder, but I could see the impending storm on the horizon. I was Michael Shannon inTake Shelter, and I was a drowning in a sea of tweets and radio proclamations of Denver dominance. I ended up not getting to sleep until about 6 a.m. on Sunday, so I ended up sleeping through the first quarter of Denver’s first playoff game with the hated Lakers. I was surprised but not upset, because I knew what I would see when I turned on the TV. Denver was getting beat up, and all the good things they were doing lately had evaporated: They couldn’t parse the paint, couldn’t make a jumpshot, couldn’t get to the free throw line, and couldn’t stop anyone on the other end. I was crestfallen, but I wasn’t angry. It felt inevitable, inexorable, endemic. I am a character in an Ingmar Bergman film, trying to talk to God but not really expecting an answer.
Denver has made the playoffs nine straight years, one of only three teams to do that. But the other two teams have won championships: Dallas in 2011, and San Antonio in 2003, 2005,and2007. Denver’s made it out of the first roundonce. The only constant on the court in all that time, sad to say, is coach George Karl. I love him; he’s great, he’s strong and triumphant over cancer and adversity, but man... sooner or later, doesn’t the finger have to point his way for to explain why the Nuggets are so consistently overmatched on the biggest stages? The few times the Nuggets have won those big games, it’s seemed to come from sheer athleticism or shots falling, not any sort of meticulous planning. Maybe his bemused look and crossed arms just isn’t the answer Denver needs? When you’ve changed everything else, and the results are still the same, maybe it’s time to rework the roof.
When the Nuggets suit up for game two tonight, I’ll once again turn it on, and I’ll once again hope with all my heart. Just because I’m not waiting for Godot doesn’t mean I wouldn’t be elated if he showed up. But everybody trying to talk that new-day no-Melo nonsense needs to realize that they’re the same kind of masochist as everyone else. Just because it’s a different mistress doesn’t mean they got rid of the whip. But let me tell you this: if the blue-and-yellow win game two; hell, if they win game two, game three,andgame four, I’m still not buying in. I’m not opening myself back up for this unless Denver gets out of the second round, because I just can’t take it. I’m tired of this team ruining my days and nights. If they get to round three, I promise I’ll dive in deep, even if that means I’ll inevitably get even more hurt for caring then. Prove it to me, Denver. Until then, I’ll be watching with the sound off.
