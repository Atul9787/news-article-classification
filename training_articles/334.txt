Phillips 66, the Houston-based company that launched Tuesday with the breakup of global oil giant ConocoPhillips, will focus on beefing up refining profits and funneling billions into its pipelines and chemicals businesses, CEOGreg Garlandsaid.
In an interview, Garland said the company will execute a number of strategies to revitalize the refining business.Phillips 66will target lower-cost oil and focus more of its refining capacity on producing diesel and other high-yield fuels. The company also will ramp up exports to foreign markets that offer higher prices for their fuel, he said.
Phillips 66 absorbed ConocoPhillips' downstream units, including its refineries, gas stations and joint venture-businesses in pipelines and chemicals.
"The spin enables the new downstream to focus on different value-creation opportunities," Garland said. "You'll see us invest aggressively in those opportunities."
In 2011, he said, refining generated about 70 percent of the income attributed to the units that now make up Phillips 66. The company operates 15 refineries worldwide, with capacity to refine 2.2 million barrels of crude per day. Investments in the refining arm will enhance its export abilities and connections to lower-cost crude, Garland said.
"But you won't see us investing to increase refining capacity," he added.
On the eve of the spinoff, ConocoPhillips announced it will sell its Trainer refinery in Pennsylvania to aDelta Airlinessubsidiary. In the absence of a suitable buyer for its Alliance refinery in Louisiana by mid-summer, Phillips will run it to process light, sweet crude, Garland said.
The company's DCP Midstream joint venture withSpectra Energywill receive $6 billion in infrastructure expansions and improvements, to capitalize on the expected rise in natural gas liquids coming out of U.S. shale. Its chemicals joint venture with Chevron has announced a new Gulf Coast world-scale ethane cracker in Baytown.
Phillips 66 will also continue ConocoPhillips' trend of buying back shares and growing shareholder dividends, Garland said.
In its first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol PSX, Phillips 66 shares opened at $33.74. The shares closed at $32.76, down 3.79 percent.
