Monday, a federal judge ruled that a state law, aimed at pulling state funds for the women's clinic, is unconstitutional.  Some pro-life groups disagree, and thinkPlanned Parenthooddoesn't have a right to the money.
"We think Planned Parenthood's lawsuit in the first place is just part of the presumption that they are entitled to funding from Texas taxpayers, let alone the constitution entitles them to the funding.  We don't think there is a basis for that," said Becky Visosky, Catholic Pro-Life Cmte. of North Texas.
Last year, the legislature passed a law forbidding state agencies from handing out funds to organizations affiliated withabortionproviders.  But, only eight Planned Parenthood clinics in the state actually perform abortions.
The judge said an injunction will stay in effect until he can hear the full arguments.
