Blackberry mobile device maker Research In Motion kicked off its annual conference by giving out thousands of prototype smartphones running its brand new operating system, Blackberry 10. The devices have been dubbed Blackbery 10 Dev Alpha smartphones by RIM.
Blackbery 10 has been announced in the wake ofsix-month free-fallof RIM's stock price. As RIM rapidly lost value, Google's mobile operating system,AndroidOS, and Apple's mobile operating system, Apple iOS, placed a stronghold on the global smartphone market. RecentComscorestatistics reveal that RIM only has a 12.3 percent of the smartphone platform market share in the U.S.;AndroidOS has 51 percent and Apple has 30.7 percent.
RIM's prototype smartphone handout was a clear attempt to encourage developers to create apps for the new operating system. RIM has made it very clear that they're targeting developers to generate interest in creating software for the platform. Apps have proven to be one of the biggest points of differentiation between Android OS, Apple iOS and other mobile operating system. Google's Android OS currently has more than450,000 appsin the Google Play store. Apple iOS currently has more than500,000 appsavailable.
In addition to app woes, phone sales haven't been great for the company either. In the first quarter of 2012, RIM only made up for6.7 percentof worldwide smartphone vendor market share according to IDC.Samsung, which primarily creates smartphones for Android OS, claimed29.1 percentmarket share and Apple garnered24.2 percent. No matter how you slice it, RIM has fallen behind in the mobile computing world.
It appears that newer Blackberry models will begin to embrace touchscreen technology, leaving behind the hard keyboards that made Blackberry phones stand out among its competitors. Blackberry previously tried creating a phone with a touchscreen (albeit, with a slide-out keyboard), but it wascriticizedfor a variety of reasons.
"TheBlackBerry10 Dev Alpha is not aBlackBerry10 smartphone for end users nor does it run the final BlackBerry 10 software - it's been created just for our developer partners to help them prepare for the launch of BlackBerry 10,"saida RIM spokesperson in a blog post. "It's important to get this prototype into the hands of our partners now so that you can help us deliver the type of high-quality content that will make BlackBerry 10 so special."
Kevin Michaluk, a writer for the blog Crackberry, has contended those that have tried to lump Blackberry together with other long-forgotten mobile phone vendors such as Palm. "BlackBerry devices are in the mainstream," said Michaluk in a CNetreport. "Palm was for early adopters. It never had the scale that BlackBerry has had."
Whether RIM can make up for lost time remains to be seen. The company is not only trying to wedge itself into a contentious smartphone vendor market, it's also trying to wedge itself into an even more contentious mobile operating system market.
