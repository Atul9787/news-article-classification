Old pro Celtics outgrind Hawks
Baltimore Orioles manager Buck Showalter (l.) gets congratulations on his 1,000th career win.
Showalter returns to where he started - the Bronx - to get the win.
The Orioles mobbed their manager,Buck Showalter, following the final out of Tuesday night’s 7-1 victory over the Yankees and toasted him with champagne in the clubhouse afterward, a celebration of sorts for Showalter notching the 1,000th victory of his career.
At first, all the buzz seemed to make the ex-Yankee manager uncomfortable, even though the milestone took place across the street from where the recorded victory No. 1 – the old Yankee Stadium back on April 7, 1992, a 4-3 decision over the Red Sox.
Showalter hemmed and hawed about the plateau and tried to divert the attention toBrian Matusz, who allowed one run in 6.1 innings and won for the first time since last June, andNick Johnson, the ex-Yankee who snapped a club-worst 0-for-29 start to the season with a seventh-inning double.
Finally, however, Showalter allowed that the moment indeed had meaning.
“I’m not going to talk about the circle of life, all that stuff,” Showalter said. “(But) I’d be less than frank if I didn’t think about” his grand victory coming in nearly the same spot as his first.
“Mr. Steinbrenner gave me a great opportunity.”
He said the team gathering around him was “embarrassing. But I can’t tell you it doesn’t tug at your heart a little… I’m an old fuddy-duddy. There’s not a day goes by that something about this game doesn’t tug at my emotions. You can’t play this game and not be emotional. It just lends to not wearing it on your sleeve.”
Showalter, who turns 56 later this month, is 1,000-958 in 14 years and is the 58th manager to win a grand. He was the Yankees’ manager from 1992-95 and has also skippered the Diamondbacks, Rangers and is in his third year guiding the O’s.
“I don’t make any bones about it – it’s about the players,” Showalter said. “It’s been an honor to be able to manage this long, so many good people, general managers and owners and people who have given me the opportunity.
“I’m looking forward to the focus being off, a little bit, but I’m really appreciative to the players for making me feel really young tonight, even though I’m an old goat.”
Showalter made it clear that he doesn’t just wallow in the victories, saying, “I remember all the losses, too…The significance is, we won a game and we’re trying to get something good for our fans in Baltimore. This is about trying to repay their trust they’ve had in us in the great baseball town it is.”
Johnson and Matusz both seemed relieved that their respective streaks were over, too. Showalter said he thought the team was “as happy about Johnson’s hit as anything else that happened,” but the manager was wrong.
“It couldn’t be more exciting, being Buck’s 1000th win,” said Matusz, who has dropped 12 consecutive decisions over 14 starts. “Growing up, I was a huge Diamondbacks fan and Showalter was the manager there and I watched a lot of his games. He’s been a great manager for so long. Such an honor to be part of that game.”
