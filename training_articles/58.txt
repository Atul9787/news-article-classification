Tuesday night was an eyebrow-raising elimination, but far from shocking.
After weeks of tireless legwork, in an effort to impress the judges and have viewers on their side, one dancing duo didn't make the cut and got the boot Tuesday night.
So how is the eliminated contestant holding up, what did they have to say after the show, and who's mad at the judges? We've got all the backstage scoop!

Elimination night usually brings about a grab bag of emotions and it was no different forJaleel WhiteandKym Johnson, who had to say goodbye to theDancingspotlight.
While everyone was ready to bid adieu toMelissa GilbertandMaksimChmerkovskiy,theywere granted reprieve from voters, sending Jaleel andRoshon Feganinto the dance duel. Unfortunately, Jaleel and Kym couldn't dance their way to safety.
There's no doubt Jaleel has been the center ofDancing's bad press this season. From a rumored bad relationship with Kym to mouthing off to the press about the judges lack of accolades toward his performances, he wasn't winning any extra points with viewers.
When we caught up with Jaleel and Kym after the show, they were obviously disappointed, but Jaleel told us he had a feeling he would be in the bottom two with Roshon. After a giving it his all and still losing a spot in the competition, Jaleel was gracious and expressed his happiness for Roshon, only wishing he could have gone further for Kym, but is extremely proud of his accomplishments.

As thankful as they were for another week of safety, Melissa Gilbert didn't hold back on expressing her anger toward the low scores she and Maks received Monday night. Having pushed herself to the edge with little credit from the judges, Melissa credits the fans for keeping her in the competition.
Next week is looking to bring double the intensity with a double elimination looming. WhileMark Ballaswill be busy trying to keepKatherine Jenkinscalm and collected,Chelsie Hightowertold us she's going to be giving some serious consideration to Roshon's wardrobe in an effort to make him "super hipster, but not nerdy.
Are you sad to see Jaleel and Kym leave the competition? Who are you rooting for to make it to the finals? Let us know in the comments!
