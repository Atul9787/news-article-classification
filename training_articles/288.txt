The Dow Jones Industrial Average has been obviously stronger than the other markets and its relative strength could be distracting. When all markets are considered, the S&amp;P 500, Nasdaq Composite, and Russell 2000 too, we see a slightly different picture than what we see from the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
Where the Dow Jones Industrials/quotes/zigman/588977/quotes/nls/diaDIA+0.55%are on the verge of developing a midterm upward sloping trading channel, the other markets have stalled and begun to turn down before they even tested the highest level of neutral resistance in their respective midterm charts. For example, the S&amp;P 500/quotes/zigman/714403/quotes/nls/spySPY+0.62%turned down before testing 1421 and if the market continues to fall without testing that highest level of neutral resistance a more bearish tone can settle into market sentiment.
However, even if the market increases to test 1421 and then begins to turn higher the recent patterns will warn us of additional and meaningful decline. If 1421 remains intact as resistance in the S&amp;P 500, the market could decline all the way to 1358 without much trouble and without breaking the current midterm neutral pattern.
Also, in offsetting the bullish read stemming from the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the Russell 2000/quotes/zigman/260873/quotes/nls/iwmIWM+0.10%is actually quite weak comparatively. One might argue that investors have chosen to put their money into safer place is recently, at least during the most recent increase from neutral midterm support to resistance. That is an interesting take away because the smaller cap stocks are usually likely to perform exceptionally well if we are entering a new growth phase.
My argument has been and will continue to be that the prospects for continued growth are slim, and a much higher probability exists in forthcoming market declines instead. I expect the economy to weaken, stocks to fall, and therefore I also consider these levels to be shorting opportunities, not only for a trade from 1421 to 1358, but for longer-term trades and lower targets over time as well.
