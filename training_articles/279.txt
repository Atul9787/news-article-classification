We know know who the Mac Flashback malware infection hurt the most: Google.
Symantec researchers dug into the code ofthe Flashback variantthat exploited a Java software flaw and infected approximately 600,000 
Macs in late March. The researchers found a rather mundane payload —a piece of click-jacking codethat redirected Google ad clicks to sites determined by the attackers.
Google never got the revenue for the redirected clicks, while the 
attackers made 0.8 cents for each one. Symantec's back-of-the-envelope 
math estimates that at its peak, the click-jacking scheme could have 
made the attackers $10,000 per day.

In other Flashback news,the Russian security firm Dr. Webcaptured much of the communications traffic that the infected machines 
were sending back to their cybercriminal command-and-control servers.
They found that more than 60 percent of the machines infected with 
Flashback were running Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard, and about 25 percent 
were running Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard, which is no longer supported by 
Apple.
[How Far Behind Is Apple's Security?]
Slightly more than 11 percent of the infected Macs were running the 
most recent version, Mac OS X 10.7 Lion. That's not because Lion users 
are smarter; it's because Apple, knowing how dodgy Java security can be,
 decided to remove Java from the default installation of Lion. (Lion 
users can install Java separately.)
Finally, Microsoft piled onto Mac users as well, witha blog postingdetailing how plenty of Macs are still vulnerable to an Office for Mac flaw that was patched back in June 2009.
(MSNBC.com is a joint venture of Microsoft and NBC Universal.)
This is the same flaw that presumably Chinese attackers have used to 
attack Tibetan and Japanese Mac users, and its prevalence shows how many
 Mac users are still completely oblivious to the risks they take by not 
updating their software.
Lion users aren't at risk for that particular flaw, Microsoft notes, sinceLion's NX (non-executable memory) featuremeans that the Office software can't be changed while it's running.
All this news essentially says one thing: If you're a Mac user running 
Snow Leopard or Lion, there's no excuse not to update your software. 
Doing so will patch the Microsoft flaw, clean your machine of Flashback 
and give Google the revenue it deserves.
If you're running Leopard — and PowerPC Mac users don't have any other 
choice — Apple doesn't care about you anymore. (Microsoft does, so apply
 the Office patch anyway.)Disable Javaas much as you can, and installMac-specific anti-virus software.
