After the success of Avengers Assemble, the actor has been signed to portray Bruce Banner and his alter ego in six more films
Mark Ruffalohas signed on to portray the Hulk in six films following the impressive debut of blockbuster superhero taleAvengers Assemble.

Ruffalo's turn as Bruce Banner and his angry green alter-ego has been widely praised. Avengers Assemble (titled The Avengers outside the UK) is on course to be one of the year's biggest films and has receivedstrong reviews.Joss Whedon's film opens in the US this weekend after debuting in the UK and elsewhere last month.

"The experience was great," Ruffalo told theCollider site during a video interviewin which he revealed his six-film deal. "I really had a good time. It was fun, and I love that group of people." Marvel studios supremoKevin Feigesaid last month that a new solo Hulk film was being considered. "When it'll be, who knows," he said. "But the conversation's definitely started."Ruffalo saidat the same event in London that he planned to "try and getJoss Whedonin a room and work out what could be a Hulk movie, with Kevin's blessing of course".

There have been two recent Hulk films, both considered underwhelming, thoughAng Lee's 2003 filmHulkhas its advocates. Australian Eric Bana played Banner in that movie, while Edward Norton took on the role for 2008'sThe Incredible Hulk, which was directed by Frenchman Louis Leterrier.

Ruffalo had the advantage, for the first time, of playing the Hulk via motion capture in Avengers Assemble. The film also features Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr), Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Captain America (Chris Evans), all of whom first appeared in their own solo movies.

As a Hulk fan, I'm excited. But even I can't see how to string the Hulk over 6 movies. Although I'm assuming some of these would be Avengers sequels.

I imagine that now the characters have all appeared together successfully they'll all be making cameo appearances in the other respective films. I'm guessing that Ruffalo's Banner will be showing up prominently in the next Iron Man films, I thought it looked like Stark had given him a job at the end of Avengers...
Or could it be that a Hulk rampage would be a hurdle for one or more of the Avengers at some point? Did anyone else hear the rumour for The Avengers that the story might at one point have been the group trying to round up Hulk?

As Toy 1988 said,  it will be a deal similar to Samuel L Jackson's nine picture deal.  Some will be feature roles, others will be cameo roles.
To go off topic somewhat, has anyone else heard any rumours that Robert Downey Jr will be departing his role as Tony Stark?

I think if the Hulk could smile a lot say 'Ho Ho Ho' and sold peas - I'd buy them
1 May 2012 2:57PM
On second thoughts has someone else done that?

Intravenous, that would be a bit of a shock! Where did you hear that?
going off topic as well, how do you actually do a proper response to a post? I can't work out whether it's  the work computer not letting me do it

KIND OF SPOILERS
They kinda did that for part of the film anyway, and it was always an underlying current throughout the film that Banner was the Hulk and therefore dangerous. I wouldn't want Hulk to be the bad guy though.
I didn't think Ruffalo was better because of the motion capture, that was just another good thing. He was better because we cared for him, the whole self-hating depression, it was more apparent.I do worry about how far a Hulk story can go, it was great in the snippets we got in Avengers, but for a whole film, it might be a lot of navel-gazing. We'll see.

You wouldn't like him when he's angry...............................

It would be cool if they went into the grey Hulk,Red Hulk and other alter egos. There was a lot of interesting material in these personas.
The grey Hulk had a personality of it's own and could articulate conversations....eventually finding employment in Vegas as a gangster boss.
The Red Hulk was a different character altogether and other representations of the hulk have explored his nascent anger issues relating to his violent father.
Just saying......................................

Downey was signed to six picture deal. 3 Ironman movies and 3 Avenger movies. After that unless he negotiates more he is done. Kevin Feige, Marvel Studio Producer says he sees Ironman like James Bond and other actors could play him but that seems a long way off. Like Connery was Bond, Downey is Ironman.

The comic Hulk has alot of stories to tell that might work. As Banner experiments on himself he becomes a Smart Hulk, a Grey Hulk, even a Red Hulk. He is even sent to another world because he is out of control that becomes Planet Hulk. There are many possibilities for that character.

It's Cooper who becomes Red Hulk, not Banner.

You're a hulk fan? ;-)

The idea of an actor playing the Hulk more than once is novel - but one doing the motion capture as well?Maybe we'll get the same actor playing Rachel in the same series of future Batman Reboots, too.Or is that pushing it?

I think it's Marvel setting up their team-up franchise. It appears to have worked with the Avengers, which was , back in the sixties, a successful attempt to stregthen the lesser selling titles by putting them together in one room. Marvel team-ups are not new. All the characters lived in NYC, and frequently bumped into each other. The Hulk was nomadic, and ran into alot of other heros back in the day.Hulk-Spiderman, Hulk- Fantastic Four, Hulk- X-men...that's the way it's going to go I reckon.

I thought the essence of Ang Lee's Hulk was fantastic, but what I really want from a Hulk film is him smashing seven shades of shit out of tanks.
As long as he's angry, I'm in.

I can be interested only if he switches from green to yellow....
