A fire that broke out at Tyler Perry's Atlanta film studio was under control late Tuesday night, the Atlanta Fire Department said.
Over 100 firefighters, 13 engines and 12 trucks responded to the four-alarm fire at the filmmaker's studio complex, and no injuries were reported, said Capt. Jolyon Bundrige.
"As far as I know, [Perry] is OK -- there was a report that he was on the scene, but I didn't see him," Bundrige told The Times.
It is unknown what caused the fire, and firefighters on the scene were continuing to investigate the source Tuesday evening, Bundrige said.
Perry's Hollywood connection has been principally with Lionsgate Entertainment, with whom the filmmaker has had a long-standing relationship. The filmmaker's next movie, "Madea's Witness Protection" -- in which he will reprise his role as a sassy, plus-size grandmother -- will be released by Lionsgate on June 29. Perry is currently in post-production on "The Marriage Counselor," which is set to hit theaters next January. TBS also ordered 35 additional episodes of Perry's sitcom "For Better or Worse" in February.
Lionsgate had no comment Tuesday night on how the fire may affect production.
According to Perry'swebsite, in 2008 his studio moved into a 200,000-square-foot location in southwest Atlanta. The studio includes a back lot, a 400-seat theater, a private screening room, five sound stages, a post-production facility, a chapel and a gym, the website said. In March, Perry hosted a fundraiser for President Barack Obama at the 30-acre complex.
