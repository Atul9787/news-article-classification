Secrets of the Ford Mustang
Tags:Samsung,Android,Touch UI,Rumors
So far Samsung has been keeping its next flagship under wraps quite successfully. We've only seen blurry shots of the externals and supposedly, those are not even the final designs.
Props to Samsung for their success so far, but could this be the first serious leak of the handset?
What we have on our hands today is an image that looks a lot like what theSamsung Galaxy S3is supposed to look like, judging by some ofthe more substantial leaksfrom the past.
Update: The image is confirmed as old and has surfaced before. It's certainly a mockup. Sorry about that, move along.
Now this photo didn't come with any extra info on the handset, but the leaked specifications for the device so far detail a 4.6 or 4.8-inch SuperAMOLED screen of 720p resolution, Samsung's latest quad-coreExynos chipset, and an 8 or 12 megapixel camera to go with those. There should also be an extra beefier battery to make the phone last a bit longer.
Now as usual, take this thing with a pinch of salt. But our guess is leaks won't get any better than this before the official announcement. Even if it's some user-land fan art, we still appreciate the effort and it's a job nicely done.
Thanks for the tip, Ali.

the design looks like nexus+sgs2 with new button = boring... no surprise... dont think the spec is gonna be ground-breaking
I can't believe a whole day has gone by without another genuine "leaked" official photo of what really is the new Galaxy S3.Also no guarantee that it absolutely positively without any shadow of doubt is going to have a dual/quad/octuple cor...
