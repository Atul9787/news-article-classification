(Marcio Jose Sanchez/ Associated Press ) - Angelina Sabuco, 2, far left, sleeps in the arms of her aunt Marites Sabuco as her mom Ginady, center right, and twin sister Angelica, far right, look on at Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital Monday, April 30, in Palo Alto, Calif. The twin sisters, who were born joined in the chest and abdomen, were separated by doctors at the Palo Alto hospital during an intricate 10-hour procedure on December 2011.
PALO ALTO, Calif. — Doctors have given a clean bill of health to two-year-old twins who were born attached at the chest and abdomen and who underwent separation surgery at Stanford University’s Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital six months ago.
Angelina and Angelica Sabuco were the guests of honor at a coming out party Monday attended by some of the 40 doctors and nurses who cared for them during last fall’s 10-hour surgery and two-week hospital stay.

Stanford University’s Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital has given two-year-old twins who were born attached at the chest and abdomen and underwent separation surgery six months ago a clean bill of health.
Wearing matching pink dresses and different colored hair bows, the California toddlers looked like any other pair of identical twins.
Angelina slept the entire time in her aunt’s arms, while Angelica shyly rebuffed her mother’s entreaties to sing for her well-wishers.
Plastic surgeon Peter Lorenz, who implanted custom-made plates in each sister’s chest to make up for their missing sternums, says their bodies are healing right on track and will continue to outgrow the evidence they once were conjoined.
