LOS ANGELES — The Denver Nuggets still believe Andrew Bynum plays illegal defense on a regular basis. They also realize it's on them to make the prolific shot-blocker's job a whole lot tougher.
After getting one-sixth of all their shots blocked in a Game 1 loss, the Nuggets will try again to force their speedy tempo on the Los Angeles Lakers in Game 2 on Tuesday night.
Rookie Kenneth Faried agrees with coach George Karl, who says Bynum is allowed to spend far too much time alone in the paint defending the rim against Denver's layup-oriented offense. Faried also realizes the Nuggets' hesitant approach made it easy.
Almost everything went smoothly for the Lakers in the opener even without Metta World Peace, but now backup big man Jordan Hill is apparently in trouble, too.
