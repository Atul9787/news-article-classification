Prosecutors have charged a 29-year-old woman with assault, saying she repeatedly put bleach into her daughter's eyes and caused permanent vision loss in the right eye.
Pierce County sheriff's deputies arrested Jennifer Mothershead Friday after a lengthy investigation. She pleaded not guilty to first-degree assault of a child Monday. Mothershead was ordered held in lieu of $150,000 bail.
Authorities say the 14-month-old girl was airlifted to Harborview Medical Center in Seattle in May after she sustained a serious head injury. The girl also had an eye infection.  Authorities later discovered that eye drops the woman said she was using to treat her daughter contained bleach.
The girl's condition improved in the hospital but doctors noted she'd lost vision in her right eye.
The girl now lives with her father.
