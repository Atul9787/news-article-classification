'THE AVENGERS' OPENS IN THEATERS FRIDAY
1 Kings of the geeks, aka Joss Whedon, ("Buffy the Vampire Slayer") wrote and directed what may be the most meta-nerd movie of all time. Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) assembles a squad of superheroes to fight Loki and save Earth. The Avengers are Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Captain America (Chris Evans), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). Expect twists, surprises and electric cameos.
NEW MUSIC FROM SANTIGOLD OUT TUESDAY
2 "Master of My Make Believe" is the latest from the effervescent Santi White. Her music is an infectious blend of electro, hip-hop and indie rock. No one makes a dance track like this Philadelphia native and fans have been clamoring for a new CD after her 2008's excellent debut "Santogold." We love the tracks "Go," "Freak Like Me," and "Big Mouth." Catch her live May 8 at the Troc in Philly.
'SNIPER ELITE V2' AVAILABLE TUESDAY
The follow-up to 2005's well-received "Sniper Elite," the next installment in this franchise offers more opportunities for some historically accurate World War II era sniping as well as added enhancements. "Sniper Elite V2" features better ballistics, co-op and two-player options and a kill cam — you can see an X-ray of where your bullet hit and how much damage it did. Super macabre. This game is available for the Xbox and PlayStation.
