HTC One X for AT&T review
While RIM has publicly stated it will not be announcing new handsets at the upcoming BlackBerry World conference, the smartphone maker has prepared developer devices that are meant for app testing.
The pictures obtained by CrackBerry show a very pretty handset that looks like anHTC Desire HD(or an iPhone 4 with the Bumper  case). The picture shows a micro-HDMI port, micro-USB, 16GB of onboard storage and what appears to be a microSD card slot on the side.
The hardware seems to lack RIM's famed physical QWERTY keyboard--could this be a sign of things to come or will we also see another model that comes with one? Whatever the case, if RIM's actual retail hardware looks equally good, perhaps the smartphone maker will have a fighting chance after all.

"Pretty" or "derivative and boring"? RIM may have a chance to hand-on to their corporate market     if that thing is cheap enough and they convince enough CIOs over dinner that having 10,000 apps is a bad thing, but I don't see consumers jumping-off the iPhone/Android/Metro ship in droves.They woke-up too late. The time to do that was before releasing the tablet, which is now in the rear view mirror miles behind Galaxy. That they can muster up a design at this point is probably a testament to the engineering staff, but it's just late.
Woops. Eagle eyes!
16GB of RAM ??? are you ok??
