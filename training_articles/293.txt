How three generations are coping with the need to save more and work longer.
UBSreported quarterly results that fell short of forecasts on Wednesday.

The Swiss bank turned in a net profit of 827 million Swiss francs ($910 million) for its first quarter, short of the 1.11 billion Swiss francs that were expected by analysts who follow the company, according to a poll from Reuters.

The Swiss bank struck a cautious second-quarter outlook, saying economic worries rattling wealthy clients such as the eurozone debt crisis, concern over Europe's banks, and the U.S. deficit are likely to take a toll.
"Failure to make progress on these key issues would make further improvements in prevailing market conditions unlikely and would have the potential to continue the headwinds for revenue growth, net interest margins and net new money," UBS said in a statement.
Nevertheless, the bank voiced confidence its flagship private banking arm would still attract fresh assets, a key bellwether for future revenue.
UBS announced in November it would scale back its investment bank business to focus on its flagship private bank.
Including one-time charges, UBSsaid profit more than halved amid a 1.16 billion Swiss franc ($1.28 billion) hit to profits due to charges on its debt.
