Hutchinson shows veteran's poise in Jays win despite rough second inning
CBSSports.com wire reportsMay 1, 2012
ANAHEIM, Calif. -- At least oneAngelsslugger       has rediscovered his power stroke, and it isn'tAlbert       Pujols.
Even after a homerless month for Los Angeles' $240 million man,Torii       Hunteris confident it won't be long before Pujols joins him in       driving the Angels to victory.
C.J. Wilsonpitched five-hit ball into the eighth inning,       Hunter homered and drove in three runs, and the Angels returned from a       rough road trip with a 4-3 victory over the miserableMinnesota       Twinson Monday night.
Chris Iannettaalso homered in the Angels' second victory in       eight games, scoring at least four runs for the first time in that       stretch. Hunter did much of the work with his third homer in four games       along with an RBI single, and he's confident the Angels' struggling       lineup is ready to break out.
"It's contagious," Hunter said. "When guys start hitting, one guy gets       hot, you all feel pretty good. Somebody is trying to pick it up, and       that's what I want to do. That's what you try to do, just lead by       example. ... You can see the sparks. The lighter isn't there yet, but       we're sparking it."
Pujols had a first-inning double for his first extra-base hit in 11       days, but went 1 for 4 while extending his homerless streak with the       Angels to 23 games and 92 at-bats, the second-longest of his career.
"It was a tough month for everybody," said Pujols, who's batting .217.       "I think Torii is the only one who's swinging the bat well. It's really       crazy to see the whole ballclub go through this."
Pujols got his eighth double of the season in the first inning before       flying out, striking out and popping to shallow center. Although he hit       a beautiful line drive that curled a few feet foul in the fifth inning,       he's creeping up on the longest homerless drought of his career -- a       27-game, 107-at-bat slump last season in St. Louis.
"We're glad, and we hope we don't oblige and let him get one," Minnesota       manager Ron Gardenhire said. "But you know it's there, and you know it's       going to happen. He's a great hitter and a great player. It's just a       matter of time. He'll figure out something, like he always does every       year, and he'll be tearing up this league before it's all said and done.       We just hope we're not the team he decides to go off on."
Hunter started the season in an 18-game homerless drought mirroring       Pujols' struggles. Hunter has a hit in 11 straight games against       Minnesota, where he played 11 seasons.
Alexi CasillaandDenard Spanbroke up Wilson's shutout bid with run-scoring hits in the eighth for       the Twins, who opened a six-game West Coast road trip with their seventh       loss in eight games. Minnesota snapped a six-game skid Sunday, but the       Twins have the majors' worst record at 6-16.
Nick Blackburn(0-3) yielded seven hits and three runs in six       innings, coming back solidly from a 30-pitch first inning for Minnesota,       and cleanup hitterJustin Morneauwent 0       for 2 before getting pulled for a pinch-hitter because of a sore left       wrist.
"The ball was coming out of my hand well, but one mistake really hurt us       -- a curve ball to Torii that I shouldn't have thrown," Blackburn said.       "I've seen that guy plenty of times, and I should know better. I've got       to make that pitch perfect."
Twins catcherJoe Mauermissed his first       game of the season to rest his sore left knee. The former MVP and       three-time AL batting champion had played every inning so far for       Minnesota, but decided the road trip opener was a good day to rest after       he got hit by a foul tip in the ninth inning of Minnesota's win over       Kansas City on Sunday.
The Angels returned from a 1-5 road trip in last place in the AL West,       already trailing Texas by nine games in their first month with Pujols       and Wilson (3-2), who has pitched at least six innings in five straight       quality starts.
"The first seven innings were about as well as I've pitched all year,       and I think the team had a lot of confidence coming back home," Wilson       said. "I came out in the eighth inning and was a little amped [about a       shutout], tried to do too much, and it bit me."
Wilson had four strikeouts while earning his first home victory for the       Angels in his native Orange County, but he gave up three runs in the       eighth.LaTroy HawkinsyieldedDanny       Valencia'sRBI single beforeScott DownsinducedRyan Doumit'sinning-ending       grounder, stranding two runners.
Downs, who unseatedJordan Waldenas       the Angels' closer last week, pitched the ninth to earn his second save.
