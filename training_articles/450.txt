Alexander Radulov was acquired to score big goals, but now he's suspended for a key game.
As Nashville general managerDavid Poilewould argue, there's no clause in team rules that states they can be ignored of it is too inconvenient for the team.
"At the end of the day, it wasn't hard at all to suspend them because it was the right thing to do," Poile told USA TODAY Sports. "It's always easy to do the right thing."
The Predators welcomed Radulov back from Russia because they believed he could be a big story in the postseason, but this isn't what they had in mind. Now trailing 2-0 to Phoenix in the most important playoff series in franchise history, the Predators will be without their leading point producer and top goal scorer in Wednesday's Game 3 because those two players decided the Arizona nightlife was too appealing.
"Team rules aren't just for the regular season," Poile said. "This is the right thing to do, and it's best for our team. It's very disappointing."
Poile said he did all of the talking in his meeting with Radulov and Kostitsyn.
"There was nothing to debate," Poile said. "They didn't say anything. I told them their actions weren't 100 percent focused or committed for a team trying to win playoff games."
What can they say?
If they didn't want to be at their best for the team, you would think they would be fully invested in the idea that having the best possible playoff run was best for both of their careers. Kostitsyn is going to be an unrestricted free agent this summer, and violating team rules in the postseason doesn't make him more attractive to potential bidders.
His decision to stay out late might have cost him $500,000 per season or more. We will never know for sure, but this certainly doesn't help his reputation.
The Radulov situation is more complex, because he will be a restricted free agent and it's unknown whether he will stay in theNHLor return to theKontinental Hockey League. Poile has always said he believes that Radulov wants to play against the world's best players, and those players are found in the NHL.
But he also wants to be paid like a star player. The best guess has been that Radulov was going to want $5 million, or more, to stay in the NHL. Let's start the negotiations by looking at his rap sheet that now includes bolting the team when he had a valid contract and then getting himself suspended for one game when the Predators are fighting for their playoff lives.
In March, Radulov looked like he could be the missing piece for this organization. Now that Radulov has been suspended, he's being cast as a bust. That's unfair, given that he's leading the team in points.
Certainly, there was hope within the organization that Radulov would have more than one goal at this point. He's certainly not a complete player, and he was not a good player in Game 2, though few Predators played well in that game. But if you watch Radulov play, he always looks like the most dangerous player in the game. He sees plays developing before other players do, and he seems to be able to find the soft spots in a team's defensive coverage.
Poile is one of the NHL's most respected general managers. He always seems to know what to say and do in times of crisis. Right now, he's selling the idea that this situation is akin to a parent disciplining their children.
"It's not that we don't love these guys," Poile said. "But they had inappropriate behavior that was not good for our team."
He is trying to keep everyone positive in a difficult time. The hope is that the other players will rise up in Radulov's absence and win Game 3 and Kostitsyn and Radulov will come out flying in Game 4 to atone for their action.
The stakes here are high. The Predators want/need a lengthy playoff run to help persuadeRyan SuterandShea Weberto stay with the organization beyond their unrestricted free agency. Suter's contract expires this summer and Weber can be unrestricted the following summer. All these guys want to stay in Nashville is to be convinced that they will be surrounded with players who will help them win aStanley Cup.
The best-case scenario was that Weber and Suter would view Radulov as being the premium score the team needs moving forward. Instead, Weber and Suter see a player who couldn't follow the rules in the playoffs. Radulov was supposed to help keep the team together. And now there's a possibility that he might have helped tear it apart.
