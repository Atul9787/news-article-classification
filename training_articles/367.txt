Los Angeles' Kobe Bryant drives on Denver's Corey Brewer during Game 2 of the Western Conference quarterfinals on Tuesday at Los Angeles. The Lakers beat the Nuggets 104-100 to take a 2-0 series lead.
For the second game in a row, he led all scorers with 38 points on 15-for-29 shooting as theLos Angeles Lakersbeat the Denver Nuggets 104-100 victory and went up 2-0 in the series.
Bryant, who missed the nine of the last 11 games of the regular season because of his shin, had 31 points on 11-for-24 shooting in 37 minutes in Game 1.
He logged 40 minutes in Tuesday's win.
When the Nuggets made a run in the fourth quarter, Bryant came through. Guarded tightly byArron Afflalo, Bryant hit a a three-pointer at the top of the key to stretch the advantage to 95-87. Bryant is a 30.3% shooter from long range during the regular season.
The Nuggets had cut the deficit to four andKenneth Fariedmishandled a pass on a fast break that might've resulted in an easy dunk. But Bryant scooped the loose ball, drove the lane and flipped it to centerAndrew Bynumfor the slam.
Bynum was fouled and hit the free throw to make it 98-91 with 2:15 left and the Nuggets never recovered.
"You really got to out-transition them. (They get) a lot of easy baskets off our dumb mistakes," Bryant toldTNTafter the game. "It's true."
Late-season trade acquisitionsRamon SessionsandJordan Hillhad major contributions. They combined for 20 points and 11 rebounds. Sessions hit key free throws in the final minutes.
"Jordan, off the bench with his length and his ability to rebound, helped us tremendously. The game and the series is going to be how well we get back in transition. That's the biggest thing."
Hill had six points and 10 rebounds as he was able to block out a pending court case in Houston for a third-degree felony charge.
Hill did not speak to reporters but offered a formal apology through a statement.
"I can't speak on (the charges) right now," he said. "I'll let my attorney and my agents take care of it. Unfortunately, it happened at this time, but I'm going to continue to keep my head up and keep working and keep playing."
Hill's emergence has given the Lakers a much-needed post presence behind Bynum andPau Gasol. He's 6-10 and athletic. When he was acquired in a trade with theHouston Rocketsin mid-March, general managerMitch Kupchakwasn't optimistic that he'd see immediate playing time.
Hill appeared in two games in March and then did step on the court for the Lakers again untilApril 17. Since then, coachMike Brownhas opted for Hill over Josh McRoberts in his rotation.
"I just wanted to give him an opportunity to see what he had and he played well," Brown said after Tuesday's morning shootaround. "He used his length, athleticism and ability to score around the basket and block shots. I just said, I'll keep playing him. If he keeps playing well, I'll keep playing him."
Hill's agent, Kevin Bradbury, told reporters a court appearance hadn't been mandated yet. The Lakers don't anticipate him to miss any playoff games.
