This is a sick joke im a huge twilight fan and i hate you mtv for doing this to us haha but your not the only award show! and you know you've been my favorite movie award show ever but now for me your the worst!!!
LOL! Twilight finally STOPPED getting nominations they don't deserve.
Did anyone verify that votes were being counted for fans outside the US?
I agree with some people on where are all the marvel movies.  They should have been included for best fight.....speaking of best fight, his name is Mikael (or Michael) Nyqvist.   I do have a bit of a problem with the movies that just came out being on here though, since it looks like they took spots that other movies would have had.  The Hunger Games should have been on next years list (where it probably would have dominated the list).  Perhaps it's time to review the qualifications MTV.
at least twilight wasn't nominated for everything. i couldn't even watch the last 3 yrs because twilight won everything. it was so predictable.:/
and that ruins the show cause nobady likes the same winners, glad that twilight will end now:)
she should've been nominated for the runaways, or maybe next year for snow white, but for twilight, noooo, and robert? cosmopolis for sure!
They've done it before. The movies that are eligible must have come out between the last year's  MTV Movie Awards and this year's MTV Movie Awards.
I think it's an interesting choice of nominees. It's the most interesting list MTV has had for a long time.  You have the blockbusters but also films like Drive, 50/50, an The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo. For once in a long time I'm looking forward to the award show. I hope to see some wins from Harry Potter, HG, Emma Stone, and Bridesmaids!
I agree. MTV has done this before. Movies that have come out earlier in the year get nominated as well. It's nothing new.
These fanwards need to stop. There is no reason for them! It's like ridiculing someone and cursing at them for liking cherry pie instead of pumpkin pie. Both are cherished-- no need to argue which is better.000a000aAnd for the people saying that THG shouldn't be nominated-- I haven't participated in previous MTV Movie Awards, but THG IS in the past year. Shouldn't it be from whenever they had the awards last year to when they post the nominations this year? I don't see what the problem is.
No complaining here. The thing is that MTV unjustly utilized a false voting system where you could vote as much as you wanted for your choice instead of the just one vote for one person each system. Apply that dumb system to American Idol or the Oscars or the Presidential Election and you have definitely chaos. MTV is waking up finally to their dumbness and owning up to it.
Can someone explain to me how can Movies like Hunger Games, The Vow, 21 Jump Street and Project X are nominated.  All of them are from 2012, hello how can they be nominated. That is really not fair for the movies of the past year. MTV is doing something wrong.
And the worldcomplain against children in the war.... so... it's only about they want HG win. No. HP will. And why is it hurt the twifans whinning? Last year and before that the HP fans were whinning. So the twilight fans must go to hell and for the others can do everything? Just because the twilight fans were stronger than anybody? Everybody had the chance to vote,
Jah, where are the art-films? the indie films?
And if there won't be HG, you would complain. Anyway, this is the first time, when they are nominated a film what came out the same year when the award is. They changed everything for HG.  For their new shiny toy. But not mine. I never loved children against children, and killing the others. Just as in the real life.
TWILIGHT SAGA ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I picked Turning Page because it is my favorite, but you're right there are many great songs in the movie.  MTV's nominations are for one song, not a soundtrack.  Not that it matters :(
It's not hating but the truth. HArry Potter deserves more awards than Twisuck. Most of the comments are whining about Twisuck
You know what sucks? Haters, who make the whole Fanwar a lot worse. If you clearly look at the Comments, you will see that HP Fans complain as well
