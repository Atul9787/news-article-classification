A Chinese manufacturing index rose in
April, signaling growth may be starting to rebound in the
world’s second-biggest economy.
The 49.3 final reading of a purchasing managers’ index fromHSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)and Markit Economics today compares with a
preliminary 49.1 reported April 23 and a final 48.3 in March. A
separate index released yesterday byChina’s statistics bureau
and logistics federation was at 53.3, indicating the fastest
growth in a year.
Improvements in manufacturing may encourage PremierWen Jiabaoto extend a two-month pause in lowering banks’ reserve
requirements. Wen is seeking to rein in property and consumer
prices without sending the economy into a so-called hard
landing. Gross domestic product increased 8.1 percent last
quarter from a year earlier, the least since 2009.
“The need for aggressive policy easing is limited given
the government’s desire to slow growth and the upside inflation
risks,” Chang Jian, a Hong Kong-based economist withBarclays
Capital, said before today’s release. “Fine-tuning measures
such as easing credit, support for first-home buyers and
expansionary fiscal policy to support infrastructure will
gradually feed through, so the slowdown in growth will bottom
out this quarter.”
The Shanghai Composite Index rose 1.2 percent as of 11:14
a.m. local time.
In a sign that China’s manufacturing remains constrained by
weakness in global demand, the HSBC PMI has indicated
contractions for six straight months, the longest run since the
global financial crisis. The official index is based on
responses from managers at more than 820 companies in 28
industries, while HSBC’s covers more than 420 companies and is
weighted toward smaller businesses.
China’s newyuanloans may have fallen to about 700 billion
yuan (US$111 billion) last month, down almost 30 percent from
March, the China Securities Journal reported today, citing
estimates from unspecified “market participants.” China’s four
major state lenders extended only 101.7 billion yuan of new
loans through April 25, the newspaper said, without saying where
it obtained the figures.
