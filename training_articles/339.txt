SUNNYVALE, Calif. (MarketWatch) — The tradition of gift-giving and “guanxi,” a term used for building a personal network of connections for mutual benefit, particularly in business, is culturally synonymous with doing business in China.
Unfortunately, this concept is often abused through bribery and unethical business practices that affect not only the corrupt executive/s but all the other stakeholders in the business.
Ethical practices in global businesses are in the spotlight in the wake of accusations that Wal-Mart Stores Inc./quotes/zigman/245476/quotes/nls/wmtWMT+0.27%used bribery to drive its expansion in Mexico, which then led to a widespread coverup.Read “Wal-Mart dogged by bribery allegations in Mexico.”
Stringent anti-bribery laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and its U.K. counterpart, the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, which prohibit companies from paying bribes to foreign officials, are being enforced with criminal prosecution and heavy penalties for those indicted. Yet corruption scandals involving multinational companies are still grabbing headlines.
Last year China’s highest national agency, the Supreme People’s Procuratorate (SPP), investigated 25,000 bribery cases.
According to the SPP, the industries worst hit by corruption are urban construction, rural infrastructure, transport and railway projects. China’s Ministry of Commerce has recently affirmed that foreign-invested enterprises should strictly obey Chinese laws when engaging in business activity related to the country.
Among the ways that China is attempting to take a tougher stance on corruption is by opening access to its centralized database of bribery convictions. This measure, recently enacted by the SPP in partnership with other state anti-corruption agencies, allows for the public disclosure of a repository of individuals and companies convicted of bribery offenses.
As a result of the new access to the centralized databases of bribery convictions, businesses in these sectors now have the ability to check companies and/or individuals throughout all of mainland China that might have bribery convictions, eliminating the cumbersome task of checking individual provinces or regions.

Anyone discovered to be on the list will likely be disqualified for bidding on government projects. According to the SPP, more than 600,000 such inquiries were submitted in 2011. The national repository of bribery convictions will help overcome geographical limitations when investigating corruption cases and make the enormous number of public inquiries more convenient and, significantly, help to reduce and prevent bribery.
Companies expanding to China or hiring representatives in China must have a thorough insight into the legal landscape of Chinese anti-corruption laws which would determine the assessment of bribery risk, mitigation strategies and reactive measures if an issue were to arise.
As companies explore global expansion, it is important to have a holistic approach toward prevention of bribery and corruption within the organization. Multinationals need to comply with regulations such as those in place in the U.S. and U.K., while some have already burnt their fingers with convictions and heavy penalties. Although bribery and corruption may be comparatively higher in certain developing nations, it is a global phenomenon and it is essential that you ensure that your organization is taking the necessary measures including implementing tight controls that comply with international anti-bribery policies.
A crucial element of building an effective anti-bribery compliance program involves a risk assessment for exposure to bribery, corruption and fraud within an environment where whistle blowing for genuine good cause is encouraged. A risk assessment typically involves conducting a “fault tree” type review. This helps to identify the major corruption risks that the organization is exposed to in relation to the effectiveness of its current level of anti-corruption controls and compliance programs (e.g., internal audit) to establish if there are any loopholes or ambiguous elements that need to be closed off. It is also important to note that regulatory requirements change from time to time, as does a company’s business environment, thus emphasizing the need for keeping the anti-bribery and anti-corruption compliance program updated through regular risk assessments.
