'Glee' recap: So Much Rain in Spain for Rachel's Parade
WINNERS: Phillip Seymour Hoffman. He sold his Willy Loman in 'Death of a Salesman.' And Cynthia Nixon - 'Wit' could bring her a second Tony.
LOSERS: Ricky Martin. Cry for him, and for snubbed Evita co-star Elena Roger.
“ONCE,” A charming romance based on an Oscar-winning indie film, led the pack Tuesday in Tony nominations with 11 nods — including best musical, director, lead actor and actress.
The other contenders named for Best Musical, the most coveted award in Broadway’s big prize fight, include “Leap of Faith,” about a fake minister, “Newsies,” about an 1899 newsboys strike, and “Nice Work If You Can Get It,” a 1920s-style show.
In a particularly robust and eclectic season that introduced 14 new comedies and dramas, the competition was fierce in the Best Play category. Two casualties
of the Tonys were the plays “Seminar” and “Magic/Bird,” which posted closing notices after getting passed over by nominators.
Making the cut were “Clybourne Park,” a dark comedy about race, the family drama “Other Desert Cities,” thePeter Panprequel “Peter and the Starcatcher,” and the S&M-themed comedy “Venus in Fur.”
In the highly competitive race for Best Actress in a play, nominees includeStockard Channing,Linda LavinandCynthia Nixon, a trio of theater pros who already have won Tonys.
They’ll duke it out with rising starNina Arianda, and British importTracie Bennett, who has turned lots of heads for her fierce portrayal of an addledJudy Garland.
The men’s races boast their share of A-listers too, as Oscar winnerPhilip Seymour Hoffman,James Earl Jones,Frank LangellaandJohn Lithgowwill vie for Best Actor in a play against each other and a young British comic actorJames Corden, who will give them a run for their money.
And one of the biggest shockers was the fact thatRicky Martin, who has made “Evita” a red-hot hit, got the cold shoulder. Both he andElena Roger, the Argentine actress who stars asEva Peronin the revival, are non-noms.
They can lick their wounds in famous company, as a starry array of actors failed to get any love from nominators. Among them areSamuel L. JacksonandAngela Bassett(“The Mountaintop”),Angela Lansbury(“The Best Man”),Blair UnderwoodandNicole Ari Parker(“A Streetcar Named Desire”),Hugh Dancy(“Venus in Fur”) andAlan Rickman(“Seminar”).
Vying for Best Actress in a musical areJan Maxwell(“Follies”),Audra McDonald(“Porgy and Bess”),Cristin Milioti(“Once”),Kelli O’Hara(“Nice Work”) andLaura Osnes(“Bonnie & Clyde”).
Best Actor in a musical candidates includeDanny Burstein(“Follies”),Jeremy Jordan(“Newsies”),Steve Kazee(“Once”),Norm Lewis(“Porgy and Bess”) andRon Raines(“Follies”).
The 66th Tony Awards will air on CBS on June 10 from the Beacon Theater.
