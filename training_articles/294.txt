Lipitor rivalry helps slash Pfizer profit by 19%

ZURICHMay 2 (Reuters) - UBS said first-quarter
profit more than halved amid a 1.16 billion Swiss franc ($1.28
billion) hit to profits due to charges on its debt.
The Swiss bank struck a cautious second-quarter outlook,
saying economic worries rattling wealthy clients such as the
eurozone debt crisis, concern over Europe's banks, and the U.S.
deficit are likely to take a toll.
"Failure to make progress on these key issues would make
further improvements in prevailing market conditions unlikely
and would have the potential to continue the headwinds for
revenue growth, net interest margins and net new money," UBS
said in a statement.
Nevertheless, the bank voiced confidence its flagship
private banking arm would still attract fresh assets, a key
bellwether for future revenue.
UBS announced in November it would scale back its investment
bank business to focus on its flagship private bank.
Net profit fell to 827 million Swiss francs from 1.807
billion a year earlier. Analysts called for net profit of 1.11
billion Swiss francs in a Reuters poll.
