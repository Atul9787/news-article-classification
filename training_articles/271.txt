There has been a lot of talk surrounding the yet unannounced flagship smartphone from Samsung. The last we heard about this handset was that it would feature a 4.8-inch display, as opposed to the previously believed 4.6-inch one that was expected to feature here. With the device set to be unveiled in a few short hours, we will finally get to know everything there is to know about the Samsung Galaxy S 3 smartphone. With the launch a few hours away, and in what may be the strangest report yet, it appears that the sources of WP-Life have informed them that Samsung is preparing to launch a handset that is exactly similar in design to the S 3, but will run on the upcoming Windows Phone 8 platform and will be launched under the name, Focus S II.
