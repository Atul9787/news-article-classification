Jets Sign a Kicker
There has been a fight with a fire extinguisher, the tossing of a shoe, devastating injuries, hard fouls, magical offensive performances and look-at-me mouthpieces.
Two games into the Heat&#x2019;s first-round matchup with the Knicks and already there are enough memories to fill an entire best-of-7 series.
And to think, the Heat&#x2019;s team plane hasn&#x2019;t even touched down in New York. That&#x2019;s when the rivalry between the Heat and Knicks is expected to get really interesting.
For Dwyane Wade and LeBron James, Game 3 on Thursday will be the first playoff games of their careers at Madison Square Garden. Wade and James have had memorable performances at Madison Square Garden, but playing at Manhattan&#x2019;s house of basketball for the first time in the postseason could be the backdrop for a historical night of postseason hoops.
&#x201C;It is no secret that besides the AmericanAirlines Arena, [Madison Square Garden] is my favorite place to play,&#x201D; Wade said. &#x201C;I look forward to how this team is going to respond in a very hostile environment with the lights as bright as they can be. It&#x2019;s going to be a tough game.&#x201D;
Backed into corner
With the Knicks down 0-2 in the series and already backed into a corner, urgency will be oozing from the MSG rafters. In the five playoff series between the Heat and Knicks, Miami had never led 2-0. Victors by a combined margin of 43 points in the first two games of the series, the Heat earned an off day Tuesday while the Knicks traveled home to regroup.
&#x201C;We have a couple days, about 24 hours to decompress and then get back to it and start to try to regenerate this energy,&#x201D; Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said.
While the trick now for the Heat is to maintain its energy level, the Knicks are still looking for a spark in this series. New York rallied in the second half of the season to make the playoffs, but its has regressed in the first two games of the first round.
In Game 1, the Knicks tied a team record for their lowest scoring total in a playoff game (67 points). In Game 2, they shot the ball well enough (49 percent) but played sloppily, especially in the second half. New York finished the game with just two more assists than turnovers (15 to 13).
Getting it done
&#x201C;We did what we were supposed to do,&#x201D; Heat forward Chris Bosh said. &#x201C;We protected our home court, and now it is their turn. New York is going to be ready. We&#x2019;re going to see a totally different team.&#x201D;
Bosh isn&#x2019;t kidding.
The Knicks have changed dramatically from game to game in this series.
Game 3 will be no different with Amare Stoudemire out. In Game 2, the Knicks were without Game 1 starting guard Iman Shumpert, who blew out his knee in the opening game of the series.
Carmelo Anthony called his team &#x201C;snakebit.&#x201D;
Amare incident
Stoudemire likely checked out of the series ungraciously after Monday&#x2019;s game when he took out his frustrations on the metal and glass housing of a fire extinguisher in the corridor leading from the court to the visitor&#x2019;s locker room.
Unfortunately for Stoudemire, he used his left hand for the job. His hand didn&#x2019;t respond well to the punch.
Paramedics stitched Stoudemire&#x2019;s hand back together after the incident, and the Knicks announced Tuesday that Stoudemire met with a hand specialist at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York and had a small muscle repaired. He will not play in Game 3, and the Knicks are listing Stoudemire as doubtful for Game 4 on Sunday.
&#x201C;You can&#x2019;t fault anybody because Amare is a good person that has high emotions at times,&#x201D; teammate Tyson Chandler said, according to The New York Times. &#x201C;One quick decision-making mistake and now you have to deal with the repercussions.&#x201D;
Stoudemire left AmericanAirlines Arena without comment Monday and apologized for destructive behavior with a Twitter message. &#x201C;We all have done thing[s] out of anger that we regret,&#x201D; Stoudemire wrote. &#x201C;That makes us human. Bad timing on my part. Sorry guys. This [too] shall pass.&#x201D;
The Knicks&#x2019; chances in this series probably have.
