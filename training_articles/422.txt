Magic's group in charge of Dodgers
ATLANTA — TheCeltics[team stats]played their best defense of this Eastern Conference quarterfinal series in the fourth quarter of last night’s 87-80 Game 2 win against the Atlanta Hawks, and some of the most important stops were made byMickael PietrusandMarquis Daniels.
ThoughPaul Pierce[stats]carried the night with his 36-point, 14-rebound performance,Keyon Doolinghit two of the biggest shots with his pair of 3-pointers in the third quarter.
Normally a reserve, Pietrus was in the starting lineup withAvery Bradleyshifting over from the 2-guard spot to run the point in place of the suspendedRajon Rondo[stats]. The bench is paying a dividend when it counts the most.
AllowKevin Garnett, the C’s resident life coach, to explain.
“I don’t know how they do it in Atlanta, I don’t know how they do it in New York or LA,” Garnett said. “But here we deal with each other. We feel confidence in each other. It’s important to have confidence in a teammate. We haven’t had a lot of practice time here. So we have to teach our young guys the importance of interacting with each other.
“We want to give them the tools. Like I said, we haven’t had a lot of practice time, but we have interaction time. That’s huge. We don’t lack any confidence here. A lot of guys have experience, and we like to make sure our young guys have that. That’s the way it works. We push them and it’s a great battle.”
Pietrus rallies
It started out as a rough night for Pietrus. He picked up three fouls in the first three minutes of the game and didn’t play the rest of the half. His third-quarter turnover, which triggeredJosh Smith’s house-shaking dunk, forced an enraged coachDoc Riversto call a timeout.
Rivers used the break to scorch the ears of everyone, though only Pietrus remained on the bench — way down the end. And yet he was on the floor down the stretch.
“I sat him down. The bench calms everyone down,” Rivers said. “He’s an excitable guy. That’s what I like. I like that passion. But I called a timeout. I gave it to a lot of guys and he was one of them. He got frustrated, which is fine.
“I just let him sit for a while, and (assistant coach)Armond Hillwas terrific. He went down to see how he was doing, and I was like, ‘Is he ready?’ And Armond said (to) give him another minute. Then Armond went back and talked to him and thought he was ready, and he went back in. Sometimes when you get those early fouls it throws you off a rhythm, and I thought it did that tonight.”
Allen watch continues
At some stage it may reach the point where the Celtics resign themselves to not havingRay Allenin this series, but for now the vigil remains.
Though the guard showed some promise during Monday’s practice at Georgia Tech, he was unable to take part in yesterday morning’s shootaround and never went out onto the Philips Arena floor for his pregame routine last night.
“I have my days, but it still hurts,” Allen said in the morning.
The frustrating part is that Allen and the C’s thought he might have turned a corner Monday.
