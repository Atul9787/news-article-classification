Asia stocks rise as US manufacturing improves
Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK)Chief
Executive OfficerAubrey McClendonwill focus on cutting debt
and expanding oil production after directors moved to strip him
of the chairman’s duties he’s held for 23 years.
The second-largest U.S. gas driller reported an unexpected
first-quarter loss yesterday, cut cash flow estimates, reduced
its drilling budget and said it may run out of money next year
under the weight of the lowest natural-gas prices in a decade.
Chesapeake’s board said it’s searching for a new chairman and
will call an early halt to an incentive program that allowed
McClendon to amass personal stakes in thousands of company-
operated wells.
McClendon, the only chairman since he cofounded the company
in 1989, raised concern among some of his biggest investors,
including Southeastern Asset Management, after news reports last
month showed that he used his stakes in company wells as
collateral to borrow hundreds of millions of dollars. Potential
conflicts between his personal and professional duties
overshadowed the CEO’s efforts to shave a net debt load that
swelled to twice the size ofExxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)’s at the end of
2011.
“The market has been catching up to the debt-laden, smoke-
and-mirrors investment model they employ,” saidSteve Shafer,
chief investment officer for Covenant Global Investors, an
Oklahoma City-based hedge fund that manages $320 million. “The
fact remains that Chesapeake has a lot of debt and it needs a
lot of debt going forward, and that sets up a potentially scary
situation.” The fund doesn’t own Chesapeake shares.
Chesapeake has hired New York public-relations firm Sard
Verbinnen & Co., which specializes in managing corporate crises,
to help handle the controversy over its CEO, Michael Kehs, a
company spokesman, said yesterday in an e-mailed statement.
Chesapeake reported a first-quarter loss of $71 million, or
11 cents a share, compared with a loss of $205 million, or 32
cents a year earlier, the Oklahoma City-based company said in a
statement yesterday after the close of trading inNew York.
Excluding one-time gains and losses, per-share earnings were 18
cents, compared to the 28 cent-average of 34 analysts’ estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.
The gas producer slashed its full-year 2012 and 2013
operating cash flow estimates by as much as 48 percent, and
increased the amount of assets it plans to sell. Chesapeake said
it may run short of cash next year after completing more than
$20 billion in asset sales to close a funding gap and pay down
debt.
Shares fell 6.5 percent to $18.40 at 5:58 p.m. in New York
after the close of regular U.S. trading. Chesapeake jumped as
much as 12 percent yesterday after the chairman’s change was
announced, the largest intraday gain since December 2008.
McClendon visited potential investors inAsiaand theMiddle Eastduring a 14-day tour in February that includedSeoul,Tokyo, Beijing,Hong Kong, New Delhi andAbu Dhabi. He
was courting overseas investors for the second time in two years
to raise cash for drilling oil-rich prospects at a time when
slumping gas prices made U.S. money-managers wary, he said in a
March 6 interview in Oklahoma City.
McClendon agreed to a board request to terminate the so-
called Founder Well Participation Program in June 2014, 18
months early, without additional compensation, Chesapeake said
in a release yesterday. He’ll retain the CEO position and won’t
relinquish any of the well stakes he acquired during the past 23
years, Kehs, the Chesapeake spokesman, said in a separate e-
mailed statement.
“They need to keep this guy on a short leash and this is
the right way to do it,” saidMark Hanson, an analyst atMorningstar Inc. (MORN)inChicago, said in a telephone interview
yesterday.
Southeastern, Chesapeake’s biggest shareholder with a 17
percent stake as of Dec. 31, pushed for the separation of the
chairman and CEO roles.
“We are pleased that the board listened to our input and
believe it has made the right decision by ending the FWPP early
and seeking an independent chairman,” O. Mason Hawkins,
chairman and CEO ofMemphis, Tennessee-based Southeastern, said
in Chesapeake’s statement.
New York City Comptroller John C. Liu, whose office manages
1.57 million Chesapeake shares worth $28.4 million in pension
funds, called the separation “a welcome step toward a more
independent board,” in a statement yesterday.
As of Dec. 31, McClendon, 52, had $846 million in loans
financing his participation in the well-ownership program. The
program, which allowed him to own up to 2.5 percent of almost
every well the company drilled, required that he pay development
costs proportionate to his stake.
As Chesapeake has grown over the past two decades,
McClendon’s need for cash to cover his well costs expanded along
with the company’s. McClendon’s personal cash crunch was
exacerbated by the plunge in natural-gas prices that delayed the
point when wells drilled in recent years began to turn a profit,
Hanson said.
McClendon had $573 million in losses on his well stakes
during the past three calendar years as lease and drilling
expenses overwhelmed gas and oil revenue, the company said in aregulatory filingyesterday. During the first quarter, he piled
on another $88 million in losses.
TheInternal Revenue Servicehas been reviewing the well-
investment program since March 2010 as part of ongoing audits of
the company’s 2008 and 2009 tax returns, Kehs said yesterday in
an e-mailed statement.
The nominating and corporate governance committee on
Chesapeake’s board is considering chairman candidates with “no
previous substantive relationship” with the company, according
to the statement.
The committee’s members are former U.S. Senator Donald L. Nickles and Louis A. Simpson, a former stock-picker atBerkshire
Hathaway Inc. (BRK/B)’s Geico Corp., whomWarren Buffettcalled a “Hall
of Fame” investor. McClendon will remain chairman until a
replacement is named.
“I’d be looking for somebody who understands the industry
with no business ties, no personal ties, no professional ties
whatsoever to Aubrey or Chesapeake,”Philip Weiss, a New York-
based analyst for Argus Research, who has called for McClendon
and the entire board to be fired, said in an interview
yesterday.
“It would also be somebody with a schedule that would
allow him or her to make this an important part of their
everyday life,” said Weiss, who owns no shares and is one of
the four analysts who rate Chesapeake a sell out of 36 that
follow the company.
Liu’s New York City comptroller’s office has proposed that
the company allow large, long-term shareholders to nominate
board candidates.
“Recent news has underscored the need for this reform,
which will be voted on at the company’s June 8th annual
meeting,” Liu said in his statement.
