A dentist in Poland, dumped by her boyfriend, got payback by removing all of her former lover’s teeth — leading his new lady to dump him, too.
Anna Mackowiakcould face three years in jail after she agreed to treat her ex-boyfriend,Marek Olszewski, when he asked her to help with a toothache just days after he broke up with her.
“I tried to be professional and detach myself from my emotions,” Mackowiak, 34, told the Daily Mail. “But when I saw him lying there I just thought, ‘What a bastard.’”
Mackowiak then allegedly gave Olszewski, 45, a massive dose of anaesthetic and coldly plucked out his teeth one by one.
She then wrapped his jaw in bandages to prevent him from opening his mouth — and then simply walked away.
“I knew something was wrong because when I woke up I couldn’t feel any teeth and my jaw was strapped up with bandages,” Olszewski told the British newspaper.
But he did not realize the horror of what happened until he got back to his Wroclaw apartment.
“But when I got home I looked in the mirror and couldn’t f---ing believe it. The b---h had emptied my mouth.”
Olszewski, who will get implants, said his new girlfriend could not handle being with a man who did not have teeth — and dumped him.
Mackowiak is being investigated for medical malpractice.
