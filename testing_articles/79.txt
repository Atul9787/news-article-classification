Birdman looks to continue expanding his growing Cash Money business with the announcement of a new ‘Rich Gang’ film.
These days there are few labels that can rival Young Money Cash Money when it comes to mainstream appeal. Home to the likes ofLil Wayne,Drake, andNicki Minaj, Birdman knows how to market, and knows how to make money.
TheCash Money CEOis looking to expand his business empire with a new movie about the Young Money Cash Money label dubbed ‘Rich Gang.’
“We start shooting that in the fall. That’s the whole team, that’s like a 2012 Balla Blocking. The Rich Gang movie is about the team. Everybody is going to be the star of it, but Wayne will be the center of it. It’s about the team, everybody that’s on the label,” Birdman toldXXL.
We imagine this movie will be an extended version of the many short videos that surface about the label, showcasingBirdmanand his crew buying new cars, travelling the world, and simply put; balling out of control.
Birdman would not reveal any details other than the fact that he will be encouraging his artists to be themselves. “I’m not gonna tell no n*gga to go to acting school. Just be yourself. We’re excited as a brand about it. Tyga, everybody is like, ‘Stunna, let’s do a  movie.’ We got a few of them lined up and we gonna shoot them.”
