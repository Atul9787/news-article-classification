UBS AG (UBSN), Switzerland’s biggest bank,
said first-quarter profit fell 54 percent on a loss at the
investment bank and an accounting charge related to the
company’s own debt.
Net income fell to 827 million Swiss francs ($910 million)
from 1.81 billion francs in the year-earlier period, the Zurich-
based bank said in a statement today. That compares with the
810.9 million-francs average estimate of nine analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg.
Chief Executive OfficerSergio Ermottiis shrinking UBS’s
investment bank by almost half as strictercapital requirementsand Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis hurt profits. Ermotti, 51,
and ChairmanKaspar Villiger, 71, in March described 2012 as “a
year of transition” for the securities unit.
“The key question is can they mitigate the decline in
revenue that is inevitable as a result of deleveraging,”Christopher Wheeler, a London-based analyst at Mediobanca SpA,
said before today’s release. He has an “underperform” rating
on UBS.
UBS has risen 1.3 percent in Zurich trading this year,
trailing the 4.4 percent gain in the 43-company BloombergEurope
Banks and Financial Services Index. Credit Suisse Group AG, its
biggest Swiss rival, has fallen 1.6 percent.
UBS said in November it intends to cut risk-weighted assets
at the investment bank by 145 billion francs from 300 billion
francs by 2016, under Basel III rules. The company said in March
thatAndrea Orcel, a top Bank of America Corp. dealmaker, will
join in July to run the investment bank with 45-year-old Carsten Kengeter.
Orcel, 48, who joined Merrill Lynch & Co. in 1992, was
among the biggest dealmakers when the firm was independent,
leading the team that helped Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
buy ABN Amro Holding NV in 2008 in the biggest banking takeover.
He was named chairman of global banking and markets afterCharlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America acquired Merrill
Lynch in September 2008.
The Italian banker, who got a reported $33.8 million in
compensation for 2008, will be joining other former Merrill
Lynch employees at UBS, including Ermotti,Robert McCann, 54,
who heads business in the Americas, and Mike Stewart, 43, who
heads the global equities business at the investment bank.
UBS’s investment bank was shaken by the discovery of a $2.3
billion loss from unauthorized trading in September, which
resulted in the departure of CEOOswald Gruebel, 68. Villiger
plans to step down at the bank’s annual shareholder meeting
tomorrow after former Bundesbank PresidentAxel Weber, 55, is
elected to the board of directors.
Credit Suisse last week reported that its securities unit
benefited less from the rebound in debt markets in the first
quarter than U.S. competitors as the Zurich-based company
accelerated the reduction of risk-weighted assets. Net income
fell to 44 million francs from 1.14 billion francs in the year-
earlier period after accounting charges related to Credit
Suisse’s own debt and costs for 2011 bonuses.
