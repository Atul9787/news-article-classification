HONG KONG (MarketWatch) — China’s factory activity cooled for a sixth straight month in April, with the slowdown beginning to drag noticeably on employment conditions, although the larger trend pointed to stabilizing conditions, according to a manufacturing survey released Wednesday.
HSBC’s monthly manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) rose to 49.3 on a 100-point scale, up from a preliminary “flash” reading of 49.1, and a full point higher than March’s 48.3 print.
A reading below the threshold of 50, indicates contraction from the previous month.
The HSBC data contrasted with an official manufacturing PMI survey by the China Federation of Logistics & Purchasing, released Tuesday, which put the April PMI at 53.3, compared with 53.1 in March.See story on China’s official PMI for April
HSBC chief China economist Hongbin Qu said the data backed up the view that Chinese economic growth is likely to bottom in the second quarter and then reaccelerate to about 8.5% on an annualized basis in the second half.
With China's torrid economic growth slowing, some foreign companies are having to look back home for profit.
“The upward revision to April’s final PMI reading, compared to the flash estimate, confirms that the pace of China’s slowdown is stabilized,” Qu said.
He said that monetary easing underway would likely begin working its way through the economy and underpin a pick-up in the coming months.
Much of the PMI showed a marginal deterioration in conditions, rather than a sector falling off a cliff, in spite of concerns over the outlook for a weakening in the global economy.
Nevertheless, a economic chill is spreading among Chinese manufacturers, with the PMI showing companies shedding jobs at the fastest pace in 37 months, as well as factory output down for the second straight month, and manufacturers reporting weakness in underlying demand.
HSBC said factories hit by the slowdown were, for the most part, not seeing the uptick in new orders that would point to better conditions on the horizon.
In some cases, anecdotal reports indicated “adverse market conditions,” HSBC said.
Still, among the bright spots in the report, new export orders were up a fraction in April, while inventories of components were drawn down slightly, HSBC said.
On the cost front, inflation related to the cost of manufacturing inputs was up slightly owing to  higher fuel and raw materials, as well as rising labor and transportation costs.
Remaining a concern, however, companies were mostly unable to pass along the rising costs of inputs to their customers.
