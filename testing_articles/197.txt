Research In Motion's new chief executive unveiled a prototype BlackBerry Tuesday powered by revamped operating system. The company has pinned its future on the software.
Thorsten Heins, who took the CEO job in January, revealed features of the BlackBerry 10 operating system running on a prototype device at the company's BlackBerry World conference in Orlando. He provided no update on the software's launch date.
Heins, who is trying to rally developers to make applications for the new operating system, promised that each developer at the conference will go home with the prototype BlackBerry. In a speech that was broadcast on the company's BlackBerry World website, Heins stressed that the device is not the finished product.
The prototype BlackBerry has a touch-screen, but no physical keyboard like most BlackBerry models. One of the new features is a modified touch-screen keypad that will allow users to select full words with a single key stroke.
Google's Android operating system powered 51 percent of U.S. smart phones in the three months ending March 31, ComScore said Tuesday.
Apple ranked second, with 31 percent, followed by Research In Motion, with 12 percent. Google's share in the previous three-month period was 47 percent, ComScore said.
Groupon said Daniel Henry, the finance chief of American Express, and Robert Bass, a vice chairman of Deloitte, will become directors, underscoring efforts to shore up investors' confidence in its accounting.
Henry was appointed Thursday to replace Starbucks Chief Executive Officer Howard Schultz, who is departing. Bass will stand for election at the June 19 shareholder meeting. He will replace Kevin Efrusy, a partner at venture-capital firm Accel Partners, who won't stand for re-election. The new directors will serve on the audit committee, Groupon said Monday.
P.F. Chang's is being acquired and taken private in a deal valued at $1.09 billion.
CEO Rick Federico said Tuesday that the deal with Centerbridge Partners will give the company greater flexibility in improving its restaurants. The company, which operates its namesake restaurants, Pei Wei Asian Diners, has been struggling to update its brand amid growing competition. Earlier this month, P.F. Chang's rolled out a new menu to lure more budget-conscious diners.
