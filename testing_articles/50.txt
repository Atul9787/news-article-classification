Continuing a habit of toying with their rules as they progress through a  season, two singers were sent home Monday from "The Voice" in an  "instant elimination" at the conclusion of the two-hour show. Two more  will be sent packing tonight. See who Christina and Blake let go.
Maroon 5 and Wiz Khalifa debuted their new song "Payphone" last night (April 16) on "The Voice." Judge Christina Aguilera also took the stage to perform her own hit "Fighter," donning a cowboy hat, glittering leotard and fishnets.
For the second night in a row, Blake Shelton felt a ridiculous amount  of pressure to make a split-second decision that would affect the lives  of his singers. He hemmed and hawed and made a call that the audience  inside the Burbank soundstage loudly supported. "It pisses me off," Shelton said after Tuesday's  elimination round of "The Voice." "It was down to the wire and I hadn't  had time to process what's in front of me. I had pressure on me."
A winged singer, the return of Cee Lo's group Goodie Mob, Adam Levine on  drums and an impressive show opener from Jamar Rogers took a back seat  Monday to Tony Lucca's musical retort to Christina Aguilera on "The  Voice."
Cee Lo Green and Adam Levine were handed simple tasks after America  selected Jamar Rogers and Tony Lucca as performers who would be moving  on to the next round in NBC's "The Voice."
For the first time this season on "The Voice," eight singers     began the night and eight of them remained once it was finished     and the coaches had turned in their scores to the vote tallying     crew.

Tonight, each team will be whittled down to one contestant     each based on the audience votes and the scores the judges give     to each of their charges. The toughest decision seems to belong     toCeeLo     Green, whose singers -- Juliet Simms and Jamar Rogers --     delivered two of the night's best performances. Rogers did an     electro-rock version of the Philly soul classic "If You Don't     Know Me By Now" and Simms tore intoJames     Brown's"It's a Man's Man's Man's World" as if she were     channelingSteven     TylerandJanis     Joplin.

"If I lose to her, I couldn't have lost to a better person,"     Rogers told Billboard.com after the show. "She's amazing. I     take my hat off to her. It feels good to be on the strongest     team this year; it means we stepped up."


Simms received the loudest and most sustained applause of     any performer in the house Monday night. She went for a glamour     look with a floor length, gold gown that matched the elegance     of the bare set (save for steps and a platform for string     players). Adding pressure to her performance was the fact that     she went eighth.

"It felt like the weight that was already on me doubled,"     she said, grateful to have shaken a few butterflies during a     group performance earlier in the evening. "It's a big     responsibility in closing out the show. You're summing up all     these amazing performers and you either go out there and kill     it or you're done."

We'll speculate that Simms is staying on as Green'     representative. As for the other competitors, we'll take:

Tony Lucca (The Heavy's "How You like Me Now") over Katrina     Parker (the Fugees' arrangement of Charles Fox and Norman     Gimbel's "Killing Me Softly With His Song") on TeamAdam.


Jermaine Paul (Journey's "Open Arms") over Erin Willett     (David Guetta and Usher's "Without You") on TeamBlake.


Chris Mann ("Ave Maria") over Lindsey Pavao (Bon Iver's     "Skinny Love") on TeamChristina.


With eight performers knowing they had 24 hours before     learning their fates -- they won't perform on tonight's show --     we chatted with them about events not seen on TV, their careers     and comical moments.

Jamar Rogers on his version of theHarold     Melvin and the Blue Noteshit: "CeeLo said a lot of people     had tweeted him saying he should give me a soul song. I added     vocoder, some synths, so to me it's Imogen Heap meets Prince. I     felt like I brought it into 21st century. We only get 45     minutes (in the studio to record) so you have to go in there     and kill. You have to go in there with a very clear and concise     plan. If I go home on this song at least it's on something that     I truly believed in. It kind of gave America a taste of what     kind of artist I'm going to be."

Chris Mann on his unique "Ave Maria": "It's a classical     music mash-up -- theSchubert'Ave Maria' matched with theCharles     Gounod'Ave Maria.' I wanted it to be simple and by putting     the Gounod second it provided a place for the song to build.     Originally we were going to do it with just piano but then we     felt it needed a little more so we added strings." It got     Billboard.com thinking -- is there a Christmas album in Mann's     future? "I think I was put on this Earth to do a Christmas     album," he said. "Some people think they're cheesy, but I think     they can be great."

Katrina Parker on back-to-back group and solo performances:     "I feel like (the group performance) was good because it kept     me out of my head -- I didn't have time to get nervous. It was     also good because it allowed (Parker and Simms) to warm up for     the crowd. I had a very quick wardrobe change after that and     there was a lot of things happening, a lot of people putting     things on me. All I wanted was a second to breathe, so it was     good and bad."

Tony Lucca on his transformation: "After last week, we     tapped into a new thing for me. I feel like we really tapped     into something transformative on thatBritneysong ('…Baby One More Time'). A happy accident that     started as response to very important feedback from a coach.     Once we tapped into that energy, I thought we should put     another log on the fire and see how long it burns. Adam said 'I     don't know if it's right' (after starting work on 'How You Like     Me Now'). More I got familiar with it the more I thought this     is my story. It's about a guy who's got a new thing."

Jermaine Paul on '80s rock: "Steve     Perry-- I'm a huge fan. That song (Journey's'Open Arms') came out at a time when male vocalists, male rock     vocalists especially, were singing in the higher register and     they sounded like men, grown men with a wife and a child.     That's what I am. I'm not a teen idol, I'm a GAM -- grown ass     man. Have to make sure I'm giving that (in the performance).     Blue collar America -- that's the life I'm living."

Juliet Simms on the video of her crying: "I was a blubbery     mess -- my face had fallen off the skull. I was actually     thankful they didn't show what really happened. I got really     emotional talking about how many years I have been working in     the rock world, which is run by men, and how many roadblocks I     have hit. It was like these worlds came together, my past and     this song. I can't describe it other than everything was being     released (emotionally)."

Lindsey Pavao on going from herBon     Iversolo tothe     Killers'"All These Things That I've Done" as a group:     "Christina and I have been kicking around ('Skinny Love') for a     long time, and this felt like the perfect time. Really delicate     and intimate, Christina wanted it to be subtle and emotional. I     love that the song is so honest. When I was done with my solo     performance, I was relieved. Then it's like a big VMA     production and you have to go from the intimate to a big number     with teammates. It's crazy because its so rushed. It's mind     blowing and it sounds cliched, but all of this has changed my     life."

Erin Willett on the effect of changing an arrangement: "When     they started playing (a slower) version (of "Without You") at     rehearsal, I thought 'oh my god this is the beginning ofMiley     Cyrus''The Climb.'' I would mess around in rehearsals     singing that. I thought let's do it our own way because     sometimes the production overpowers the message (inGuetta'sversion). Funny thing is, the stage people thought I was going     to do the uptempo version and I was going to have a DJ. Then     they were sent the version we did. They came back and said 'so,     we just spent all this money on light-up sunglasses and disco     skirts.' Apparently those are going to be party favors at the     wrap party."
