For one woman, breaking up is much like pulling teeth — or at least the revenge of being dumped came down to that.
According toa report by the Austrian Times, Anna Mackowiak, 34,faces three years in prison in Wroclaw, Poland for removing all of her boyfriend’s teeth after he dumped her for a new woman.Mackowiak’s ex-boyfriend Marek Olszewski, 45, reportedly showed up to her office complaining of tooth pain just days after dumping her.
Machowiak admitted she was unable to maintain her professionalism and instead saw the visit as an opportunity to seek revenge.
"I tried to be professional and detach myself from my emotions,” she reportedly said. “But when I saw him lying there I just thought, 'What a bastard' and decided to take all his teeth out.”
Machowiak gave her ex a heavy dose of anesthesia — putting him to sleep, then plucked out all of his teeth. She then bandaged his head and jaw and when he woke up, told him he would need to see a specialist as there had been complications.
Marek said he suspected something was wrong the minute he woke up to find his mouth numb and bandaged but had no reason to suspect his ex-girlfriend had acted improperly.
"I didn’t have any reason to doubt her,” he admitted,  “I mean I thought she was a professional.”
Marek said when he went home he was alarmed to find he was in fact toothless.
His new girlfriend has reportedly left him since the incident and he is now preoccupied with getting dentures to replace his missing teeth.
Machowiak is reportedly under investigation by the prosecutor for medical malpractice and abusing the trust of a patient.

That is really insane,for any person too do that too another person.She should get five years in jail for that,  and a smack in the face by her ex boyfriend.

At least he didnt' ask for a vasectomy.

Yea.  I actually felt bad for the guy until I read he wen't to her for treatment days after dumping her for another woman.  Ummm bad idea ya think?  He can't of liked his teeth that much.  Pay another freeken dentist dumbazz.  O well, live and learn....

Exactly. She was wrong, and hopefully that's the last thing she'll do as a dentist- but I have more sympathy for her in this case.  The nerve of him to leave her for another woman, and then go back in a few days later and look to her for help- such arrogance.  If  you're going to leave your girlfriend for another- then just leave her alone.

Jers - I actually have NO sympathy for HER.  I felt really bad for the dude UNTIL I realized he actually dumped her and then went to her for (presumably) discounted dental care.  Just LOL.  That's all I can say.  Poor dumb schmuck.

JerseyCityGirl — So breaking up with a woman means she is justified to rip his teeth out and cause lifelong physical harm?   This woman will lose her dental license and deserves to go to jail for 20 years.

Right. That's exactly what my post says. Good job.

Here's Time magazine New Woman of the Year for 2012!

She graduated the "Boys From Brazil" Dental Academy of excellence. Her x boyfriend is sharp like a marble to even consider going to see her for dental care after the break up. Good thing she wasn't a Urologist.

Lol

You got that right,I would of never went back to my ex girl friend for any kind of dental work,  if she was a dentist, or a doctor of any kind.You never know how some will react after a brek up in a realationship of any kind.

Talk about an 'indentured' servant....he's really got to get a polygrip on life and move on...bite down, rinse, spit....

Is this a Polish joke?

I'm gonna call BS on this story.  The first line of the article says the dentist is facing 3 years in jail, then the last line says she is "under investigation".  So which is it?  Are they investigating her or has she been charged with something to which they can attach a potential jail sentence.
Well, that and the fact that the Austrian Times is also running the story "German pirate funds himself by prostitution".  I'm thinking the Austrian Times is a lot more like the Weekly World News than the NY Times.
