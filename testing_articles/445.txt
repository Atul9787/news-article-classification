Jets sign kicker Brown

The Nashville Predators already faced a tough challenge returning home, down, 0-2, to the Phoenix Coyotes in their Western Conference semifinal.
Now, they either have something to rally around with forwardsAlexander RadulovandAndrei Kostitsynsuspended for Game 3 Wednesday night or wind up with another excuse.
The Predators announced the suspensions Tuesday, and general managerDavid Poileand coachBarry Trotzsaid the decision to punish the forwards for violating unspecified team rules was easy. Poile is leaving the decision on their return for Game 4 Friday up to Trotz.
Poile refused to specify what the players did, saying any hint would give away what they did. He called the behavior unfortunate and selfish.
"I hope there is some remorse for what they did," Poile said. "Time will tell with their behavior and if they get the opportunity to get back into the lineup."
The timing could not be worse. The Predators have not trailed 2-0 in a series since 2008 against Detroit. They evened that series by taking both games on home ice before losing in six games.
"Every team that has success in the playoffs has to go through some adversity," Trotz said. "They haven't had to go through a whole lot of adversity yet, so this is a good test. When you go through adversity, it really reveals your character so we're going to find out what kind of character we do have."
Radulov hinted the violation was curfew-related, saying "I didn't come back that late that they were saying, but like I said before, I don't want to talk about it. They did what they had to. I am disappointed, and I understand what is my mistake."
Trotz's options for replacements includeMatt Halischuk, who has not played since Game 4 in Detroit, rookieCraig SmithorJordin Tootoo.
Capitals
Alex Ovechkin's playing time keeps shrinking in the playoffs, all the way down to a career-low 13 1/2 minutes in Game 2 of Washington's Eastern Conference semifinal against the New York Rangers. Seems to be working so far. Despite the reduced action, Washington's captain and leading scorer scored the winning goal on a power play in Game 2.
"To be honest, it's not even something that we notice. We don't go down the sheet at the end of the game and say, 'How much did 'Ovi' play?' That's just not something that we do," Capitals defensemanKarl Alznersaid Tuesday, a day off for Washington's players. "You know he wants to play more, and he's frustrated by not playing 20 minutes. But he doesn't care -- he wants to win that game."
Ovechkin leads the Capitals in playoff goals (three) and in points (six), but coachDale Hunterhides Ovechkin on the bench for long stretches at a time, especially when the Capitals are trying to protect a lead.
John Tortorella's answers at news conferences are about as short as Ovechkin's playoff ice time. The irritable New York coach disdains the media gatherings he is required to hold as his top-seeded club faces Washington. Part of it is Tortorella's desire to keep things out of the public view as he tries to guide the Rangers deep into the postseason. The other seems to be his desire to maintain a hard edge.
"I'm not going to give you much information," Tortorella said. "Some of you guys sit here and tell me I'm curt or whatever. I'm sorry I'm not a guy that wants to converse about everything during the playoffs."
