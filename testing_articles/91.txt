'Avengers' bad boy Hiddleston wreaks wicked fun
Atlanta (CNN)-- A multiple-alarm fire broke out Tuesday night in a building at the Tyler Perry Studios in southwest Atlanta, a fire official told CNN.
It was subsequently extinguished, but firefighters were still checking the area for hotspots. It was not immediately clear what started the blaze.
One building partially collapsed, said Captain J.L. Bundrige with the Atlanta Fire Department. The fire was reported at 8:54 p.m., he said.
There were no reports of injuries.
The studios sit on 60 acres and include five sound stages, a 5-acre pond, a theater, a chapel, a commissary, a gymnasium, Perry's office, an art department where sets are designed, hair and makeup facilities, a wardrobe department, set decoration, a post-production facility and a backlot named 34th Street, "as in Miracle on 34th Street," according to a video posted on the studio's website.
Perry's credits include work as director, writer, producer, actor and playwright.
His TV shows "Meet the Browns" and "House of Payne" are huge moneymakers, as are Perry's wildly popular movies.
Last year, Perry topped Forbes' "Entertainment's Highest-Paid Men" list, raking in $130 million in 12 months beginning in May 2010.
