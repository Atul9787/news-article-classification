OMG, who got the boot and who issoclose to winningThe Voice?!
The final member from each team was revealed tonight after combining America's votes with their coaches scores (out of 100).
After a reunion with last season's final four (Beverly McClennan,Vikki Martinez,Dia FramptonandJavier Colon) and live performances from each, we were witnessing the chopping the block.
Here's what happened...

Team Christina
It was betweenChris MannandLindsey Pavao. CoachChristina Aguileragave each singer an equal 50 score and left it up to America to see who would move on with the competition. It was close, but Pavao got sent home after receiving eight points less than Mann.
Team Adam
There wasn't an even split when it came toTony LuccaandKatrina Parker.Adam Levinegave Lucca a 60 and Parker a 40, which he explained wasn't about talent, but because Levine felt a stronger connection with Tony. After America's votes got weighed in, it was clear that Tony would move on to the finals and Katrina was out.

Team Blake
Blake Sheltonseemed to follow Christina's path by giving bothErin WillettandJermaine Paula 50, but America chose to keep Jermaine, meaning Erin was sent packing.
Team Cee Lo
This was probably one of the toughest boots to predict. BothJamar RogersandJuliet Simmswere consistent in giving a powerful show and seemed to be favored by fans. We anticipated an even 50-50 fromCee Lo Green, but he actually gave Jamar 40 and Juliet 60 based on last night's performances. And even bigger shocker was the huge gap after America's votes were added in. Juliet ended with a 121, while Jamar had a 79.
Now that we have our final four, who do you think is going to win it all? Let us know in the comments!
