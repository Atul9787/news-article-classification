This isn't the sort of hot propertyTyler Perrywants on his hands.
A four-alarm fire ripped through the filmmaker's Atlanta studio lot, the home base for the various TV and movie projects on Perry's increasingly packed producing and directing résumé, the Atlanta Police Department confirmed Tuesday to E! News.
Of course, the most important thing is whether or not anybody was on the premises at the time.

And happily, no injuries have been reported.
Per Atlanta'sChannel 2 Action News, firefighters had managed to extinguish the flames by 10 p.m. but continued to battle various hot spots into the night. At least one building on the 30-acre lot had partially collapsed, according to Atlanta Fire Rescue. Among the structures with the 200,000-square-foot Tyler Perry Studios are a 400-seat theater and numerous sets and sound stages.
There's no word yet on what may have caused the blaze.
Perry opened the lot in October 2008. Last year,Kim Kardashianwasin town for her role inThe Marriage Counselor, and Perry hosted a fundraiser for PresidentBarack Obamaat the studio in March.
His latest film,Madea's Witness Protection, opens June 29.
