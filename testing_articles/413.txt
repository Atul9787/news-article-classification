Bryce Harper runs off the field in the seventh inning in his home debut with the Nationals.
The 19-year-old outfielder's arm was more impressive than his bat in a 5-1 loss to Arizona that continued offensive struggles theWashington Nationalshope Harper can help alleviate.
"I went into my first at-bat a little excited," Harper said of a strikeout that was surrounded by standing ovations from the crowd of 22,675, larger than a usual Tuesday night but far from capacity. "I chased two pitches I shouldn't have. I calmed down after that."
The closest he came to a hit was a hard grounder up the middle but right to Diamondbacks shortstopJohn McDonald, one of two groundouts in an 0-for-3 night that leaves Harper 2-for-9 in his short career.
"I haven't seen a shift since college," Harper said of Arizona's defensive alignment.
But he's seen the steady diet of off-speed pitches Diamondbacks starterTrevor Cahillthrew him to help hold the Nationals to six hits and just their 30thrun in their past 12 games.
"I've been seeing off-speed all my life," Harper said. "I should be able to hit it by now."
After hitting the first batting-practice pitch he saw into the center field seats, Harper's first real home highlight came on an accurate 300-foot throw on the fly from deep left field that narrowly missed getting McDonald at the plate in the seventh inning.
"He belongs here right now, he fits," managerDavey Johnsonsaid before Tuesday's game. "He's not just happy to be here. He's probably wondering what took so long."
Harper's challenge now is determining how long he stays in Washington.
"I don't think I have to prove anything," Harper said. "I'm going to try to stay up here as long as I can. A lot of guys my age have gone up and down. I'm just going to enjoy my time up here as long as I can, have some fun."
The first-place Nationals aren't looking for him to carry them on his back, though Johnson said he's not sure how much longer he'll keep Harper as low as seventh in the batting order, where he has been so far. Washington has three or fewer runs in eight of its past nine games.
Harper got the call from Class AAA Syracuse (N.Y.) last weekend because injuries have depleted the Washington offense. Third basemanRyan Zimmermanbegan throwing Tuesday in his rehab from a sore shoulder.
Johnson said he expects Zimmerman to begin swinging Friday, which could make him ready Sunday when he's eligible to come off the disabled list.
Harper was diplomatic about the possibilities.
"Getting (Zimmerman) back in the lineup will be huge for this team," he said, knowing someone will be dropped from the roster when that happens.
Having Harper could be, too.
