ForBirdmanand his Young     Money/Cash Money crew, the charts are not the only thing to     conquer. Up next: Hollywood.In an interview withXXL, the YMCMB leader (and Billboard Power     100 player) talked up the launch later this year of his Cash     Money Films project, which will serve as his creative outlet on     the silver screen. With a few much-rumored projects in the     works (including one with Omar Epps), he did confirm that he's     looking to put the whole YMCMB roster - which featuresDrake,Nicki Minaj,Mystikal,Busta Rhymes,Limp Bizkit, andLil Wayne, among others -     into one film, with Weezy as the star. The movie is set to be     titled "Rich Gang."

Limp Bizkit-Lil Wayne Single Has 'Hip-Hop-Rock     Swagger,' says Birdman

"We start shooting that in the fall," Birdman said. "That's     the whole team. The Rich Gang movie is about the team.     Everybody is going to be the star of it, but Wayne will be the     center of it. It's about the team, everybody that's on the     label."It's unclear if that means that each artist will adopt some     type of persona as part of a scripted film or if the project     will be more of a documentary of the label, but it seems like     Birdman is leaving that part of the process open-ended, at     least for now."I would like them for just be themselves," Birdman continued.     "I'm not gonna tell no ni**a to go to acting school. Just be     yourself. We're excited as a brand about it. We got a few of     them lined up and we gonna shoot them."The CEO spoke to XXL while at the book launch for Wahida     Clark's latest, titled "Payback Ain't Enough," which is out on     the Cash Money Content book publishing division, and stated his     desire to get her involved in his budding movie enterprise as     well."When I got her collection, I was amazed at all the books she     did already," he said of meeting the author. "I said, 'This is     somebody I need to get into business with. She's hungry.' I'm     looking forward to Wahida writing a script to one of her     scripts and turning it into a movie."
