You’ve probably felt it in your bones for a while, but now it’s official as Activision have confirmed the Call of Duty game this year will be a sequel to Black Ops. Unlike the first game that took place in the Cold War, this one will take place in the near future and will deal with the looming threat of all out global conflict.  While Black Ops looks like any prior Call of Duty game, it’s interesting to see that Treyarch have now added in a bit of open endedness into the game. This doesn’t mean the franchise is now in open world territory; it means that players will have a choice in undertaking certain missions and the story will then play out depending on the choices they made. At the same time, these choices may also affect the fate of some of their squad mates.These concepts aren’t exactly unheard of in the industry, but it’s refreshing to see Treyarch try something different with the franchise. Expect more Call of Duty: Black Ops II at E3 2012, but in the meantime, mark the 13th of November, 2012, since that’s when the game will release for the Xbox360, PS3 and PC.
