After just six months of dating, Simpson, 31, and Johnson, 32, got engaged in November 2010. The pair--who have yet to set a wedding date--had planned to hold off on making it official until after their baby's arrival. Rushing down the aisle isn't a priority for the star and her former NFL player beau, anyway; during a March appearance onJimmy Kimmel's show, Simpson told the host that Johnson "feels like my husband already."

Simpson first shared her own happy pregnancy news with the world on Twitter last Halloween.
Tweeting a photoof her wrapped in a mummy costume, she wrote, "It's true! I am going to be a mummy!"
Since then, theFashion Starmentor and Johnson have been counting down the days 'til their little one's arrival. In December, Simpson opened up toUs Weeklyabout her excitement for "mummy"-hood.

"Eric and I love each other so much, and knowing that I love this baby inside of me is so amazing--I love it so much and I haven't even met them yet," Simpson gushed. "I can't imagine how much love we'll have for it once it finally comes!"
As her due date approached, the bubbly, uninhibited singer spoke candidly about the not-so-pretty parts of pregnancy, dishing on her strange cravings (buttered Pop Tarts!) and embarrassing physical traits ("I just started calling myself Swamp Ass," Simpson toldJay Lenoof sweating through her maternity Spanx.)

Among the most outrageous? During a March interview onJimmy Kimmel Live, Simpson made even seasoned comedian Kimmel blush when she admitted, "I feel like I have a bowling ball sitting on my hoohah. Apparently I have a lot of amniotic fluid, so whenever my water breaks, it will be like a fire hydrant!"
And speaking toRyan Seacrestin an appearance on his radio show last month, the fashion designer opened up about her third-trimester sex drive. "I am definitely 'feeling intimate,'" Simpson told the host. "I'm kind of unstoppable right now. The Big O is, like, the biggest O ever!"

Love you Jess you are going to be an excellent mother
-from a fellow Dallas girl
oh congratulations to the mom *and* dad
I wonder how they will call her. Maxy? MD? Drew?
Wow....her baby, her name choice, but wow...
To Michelle Knight, its called a caesarean birth, and no you do not just wake up with a baby in your room, in fact the mother is awake during the birth, and the father is present during the birth as well. The famous "Epie" that many Mom's are using again for child birth pain control, is used with Caesarean Births as well!! I am not an advocate of the "epie" for vaginal Births,due to dulling moms natual urge to push, and not really allowing to give it her all with each contraction, therefore slowing the delivery time. Although it will allow mom to be awake during, and saves needed time if the infant becomes stressed and a caesarean birth called for. An almost 10lb baby is a large baby an esp. for a first birth, also Jessica herself seemed to have gained more weight than what is normal for a first- pregnancy, possible some gestationl Diabetes?
I don't care how she picked the name.  It's as bad as Apple.  By the way, is that a Delicious or MacIntosh?  Have you heard of "Maxwell Smart"??
I'm  sure  she's  glad  that's  popped  out---, now  the  real work  starts-----congrats!!!
Thank goodness!  I have never been so glad that I don't have to see any more article listed that open with "Pregnant Jessica Simpson..."
IT'S ABOUT TIME!!!!!!!!!!!! but congrats!!!!!!!!
I don't think this kid needs your pity. She will inherit billions someday. She will live life in the lap of luxury with a family that clearly loves her. All the best to Jessica and Eric. Oh and yes, she gave BIRTH via c-section.
Sounds to me like they were prepared for a boy and just decided to keep the name for their daughter. I pity her when she is in school and hope the kids don't make fun of her.
Maxi is cute!
Jessica and Eric will be wonderful parents. Maxwell is going to have a great life
Welcome to the world, Maxi pad Johnson.  Seriously, I understand it's trendy now to name your baby girl a traditionally boy's name but Maxwell?  She is going to be called Maxi Pad for her entire childhood.
How did TWO people decide that Maxwell was a great name for a girl?  Jessica is so girly, I thought.  Yes, I know it is their business what to name the baby, but having an opinion about a name is fine too.
I wish them all the best.  However, dumb name for a girl.  What happened to her naming her daughter a normal name!  Maxwell is a boy's name!
Natalie, Lisa is right... but I have a question... if you DON'T GIVE BIRTH DUE TO HAVING A C-SECTION, WHAT IS IT CALLED when a child shows up in the room after having it cut from your body?  Spontaneous or miraculous arrival?  Did you have a stork come thru the room and just drop your kids in your arms?  Tell me, cause I'm DYING to know!!! Congrats to the happy new parents on their healthy baby girl!
I knew it was a girl. All the weight she gained and how she carried it. Congrats Jessica. Love the name. Boy names for girls is cute. They will probably call her Maxie or Max. Can't wait to see pics :-)
