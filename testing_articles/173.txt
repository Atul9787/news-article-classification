Results pending on Asheville tempeh-salmonella link
This is the heartbreaking video message that convinced a biotech company to give a dying mother a potentially lifesaving cancer drug before its scheduled release.
Breast cancer patient Darlene Gant made the video after biotech firm Genentech informed her she would not be able to access drug Pertuzumab because it would not be formally approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) until June.
But 46-year-old Ms Gant has stage-four breast cancer and is quickly running out of time.
"I am not expected to make it to June, my liver is engulfed with tumours and I am wasting away," she wrote on YouTube on April 16.
She hoped the video would convince the company to release the drug to her on compassionate grounds.
"Here I am with a drain coming out of my liver, barely able to eat…I've watched my muscle mass disappear, my skin hang like I'm 90…I'm in pain all the time," she says in the video.
"Although I don't put everything into Pertuzumab it could stabilise me and extend my time here on earth with my 11-year-old son and my family."
She is seen lying in bed writing cards for her son to read on future birthdays, graduations and even his wedding day after she has died.
"It's pretty sad that cancer has taken my life to this point that I have to plan what I'm going to do for my son so he remembers me," she says before bursting into tears.
After the YouTube video was picked up by US media, Genentech was hammered with phone calls from the public asking for the company to give Ms Gant the drug.
The company agreed to release the drug and Ms Gant was given her first dose last week, CNN reports.
