MacBook Pro 2012 amps up with SSD and battery
So maybe that $1 billion it cost Facebook to buyInstagramwas a bargain after all.
The photo-sharing app is on fire. It now has more than 50 million users — and is adding new ones at the rate of roughly 5 million per week, according to its API.
Instagram hit 40 million users around April 13, and 30 million at the start of the month (no April Fooling). This is astonishing growth for an app that started 2012 with just 15 million users.
Of course, the fact that the app wasrecently releasedforAndroid— after being iPhone-only for its first two years — is likely driving a lot of those sign-ups. But Instagram also hit number one in the iOS App store for the first time in the wake of theFacebookacquisition.
Google doesn’t break out exactly how many Android downloads an app gets onits Google Play page. But Instagram did cross the 10 million download threshold two days ago, so it’s a safe bet that roughly 40 million of those users are on the iPhone.
In other words, iPhone and Android have divided Instagram sign-ups fairly equally since it became available for both platforms. (So much for Apple executive Phil Schiller’s claim that the app had“jumped the shark.”)
And who is Instagram user number 50 million? According to Gramfeed, it’s auser named fox289. All we know about the user is drawn from his or her profile picture: an FC Barcelona soccer shirt. Just how many accounts are like fox289 — with no photos posted, no users followed — is something Facebook will be very interested in.

It would be great if it will happen!http://goo.gl/ZLnhC.
Looks like fox289 is famous now.
yup
It is only 50 million right now i would say.But with Samsung S3, iPhone 5, Google’s next generation Nexus phone releasing later this year, i would expect more smartphone sales than ever and ultimately few first time buyers will definitely become users of this awesome app. So i think, these numbers will only grow exponentially at least for one more year.
Maybe the law of diminishing returns is yet to kick in…
Looks Great
Really Cool in looks !! It would be good.
Facebook seems to have the Midas touch anything it touch turns into gold and it have been benefited from the purchase of instagram. Mobile world is the future and Facebook have been a trend maker. Long Live the Social King
It’s a good news
It seems now lot of Indians too using Instagram ! :D
Great Application

60% of the new users are teenagers that are messing up what Instagram used to be about. Just look at the popular page from a year ago, and compare it to today’s popular page. Instagram has shifted from a photography app to a pop culture app.
I personally hope that these teenagers leave because I’m sick of those one direction photos, I don’t have a problem with the band, but they are destroying the creative nature of Instagram and long time users are very, very frustrated with this.@frederikv
You sound just like Internet aficionados from long ago who started getting mad when the general public started going online. This need to ‘keep everything for yourself’, is a recurring theme when a well established platform becomes popular. You’ll get over it.
Frederik’s post reminds me of what teenagers said when their parents made it to Facebook and what recruiters/professionals say when other post twitter posts in their LinkedIn posts. All legitimate feelings but unenforceable all the same.

Instagram Passes 50 Million Users, Adds 5 Million a Week
Ah the power of Android
No not really.. Google Play stats show that Instagram downloads fall between 10 and 50 MILLION downloads. It is more likely that iOS was around 25 million with probable gain of a few million here and there and that Android is responsible for these massive numbers.
Why is it so hard for people to admit that Android is ONE KILLER platform and that it has massive amounts of users. It’s a gold mine and we see now clearly that’s true. Instagram got 20-30 million users thanks to Android in month or two which is more than it took them to achieve 15 million in 18 months.
That’s the testament at how powerful Android platform is.
