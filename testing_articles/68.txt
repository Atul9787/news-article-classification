"The Artist" may have dominated the Oscars, but movies of the louder variety were the focus as the 2012 MTV Movie Awards nominations were announced Tuesday.
"The Hunger Games" and "Bridesmaids" are the early favorites with eight nominations apiece, though "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part II" scored six nominations and is likely to net at least a few Golden Statuettes in fans' last chance to fete the franchise.
Fans will be able to vote on MTV.com for the Movie of the Year winner from a field that includes "Bridesmaids" "The Hunger Games" "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2" "The Help" (one of the few Oscar contenders to have a presence among the nominations) and the critically panned, but popular "The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1".
The Best Male Performance nominees areDaniel Radcliffe("Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2"),Ryan Gosling("Drive"),Joseph Gordon-Levitt("50/50"),Josh Hutcherson("The Hunger Games") andChanning Tatum, "The Vow".
The finalists for Best Female Performance areJennifer Lawrence("The Hunger Games"),Kristen Wiig, ("Bridesmaids"),Emma Stone, ("Crazy, Stupid, Love"),Emma Watson("Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2") andRooney Mara("The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo").
"Bridesmaids" starsMelissa McCarthyand Kristen Wiig lead the nominees for Best Comedic Peformance, which also includesZach Galifianakis("The Hangover Part II"),Jonah Hill("21 Jump Street") andOliver Cooper(Project X").
In addition to fan-favorite categories like Best On-Screen Kiss and Best Fight, there are also a batch of new categories. Most are unlikely to be ever adopted by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences, including Best Gut-Wrenching Performance and Best On-Screen Dirtbag.
The awards show will air live on MTV from the L.A.'s Gibson Amphitheatre on June 3 at 9 p.m. EST.
