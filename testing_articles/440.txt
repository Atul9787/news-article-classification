MIAMI -- It was chaos on the loading dock of American Airlines Arena, asKnicksstarAmar'e Stoudemirewalked slowly out       of the building with a flock of reporters and cameramen chasing him.       Here was Stoudemire, his left hand bandaged and arm in a sling, walking       through a metal detector and being wanded by a security guard.
"Get back! Get back! All media get back!" arena workers shouted.Tyson       Chandlerand several Knicks assistant coaches waited to follow       Stoudemire to the team bus for the trip to the airport. Cameramen held       their hardware aloft and still photographers snapped their shutters with       fury, trying to get the money shot -- the Knicks' $100 million man on       his walk of pain.
Amar'e and the Knicks pay the price after he punches the metal box that houses a fire extinguisher.(AP)About 100 yards away, the metal box that housed a fire extinguisher       outside the tunnel entrance to the Knicks' locker room had been on the       winning end of a fight. Stoudemire, unable to get involved for more than       a few possessions at a time as the Knicks fell into an 0-2 hole with a       104-94 loss to theMiami Heaton Monday night,       evidently had punched the metal door handle with his left hand. The       sharp metal handle was badly bent, the two screws holding it in place       mangled.
"There was a lot of blood," one person said, citing witnesses.
Chaos. No sooner had Heat coach Erik Spoelstra descended the interview       dais, word began to circulate that paramedics had been summoned to the       Knicks' locker room. Knicks coach Mike Woodson was on his way to the       podium, and 25 or 30 media members waited outside the Knicks' locker       room as reporters scurried back and forth, hysteria breaking loose in       the bowels of the arena.
By the time media were allowed in, the room was empty except for       Chandler,Carmelo Anthonyand assistant       coach Darrell Walker, who sat on a chair outside the rear entrance to       the locker room, beyond which Stoudemire had unleashed his fury. The       door was closed; the damage obscured in the tense moments after the       carnage. Stoudemire was nowhere to be seen.
A world of hurt besieged Stoudemire this year -- the death of his       brother, a back injury that robbed him of the explosiveness on which an       All-Star career had been built. Now this. It was toward that door where       Stoudemire had been headed, having suffered the indignity of another       playoff loss and another night spent mostly as a decoy -- an       afterthought.
Smash. Out came the frustration, the anguish, the anger. And       the blood. Out went the Knicks on the losing end in the postseason       again, more than 11 years since they last won a playoff game.       Four-thousand, twenty days and counting.
Stoudemire doesn't know about all that. Doesn't need to. But he knows       that he came to New York to resurrect the franchise two years ago, and       he did, and now he's a shadow -- a ghost. And now, who knows? That       left-handed punch might've been his last play of the season.
Details of Stoudemire's condition were sketchy. How many stitches? Were       there any broken bones? Any lacerated ligaments? Nobody was saying. But       you didn't need an X-ray machine or a frank dispersal of medical details       to understand the trigger that had gone off for Stoudemire on his       journey -- all of 10 seconds or so -- from the court to the locker room.
"I am so mad at myself right now," Stoudemire tweeted early Tuesday. "I       want to apologize to the fans and my team, not proud of my actions,       headed home for a new start."
Hours earlier, Stoudemire had been in a side room out of view of the       media gathered in the locker room before the game. A loud thud -- and       then another one, and another -- punctuated the pregame quiet. Again and       again, these violent collisions, like a carpenter taking down drywall.       It was Stoudemire, working with the medicine ball as he warmed up and       worked up a pregame sweat.
Then, to the court, where Stoudemire -- methodically and with an edge       about him -- went through his pregame shooting routine. I remember       thinking if there were ever a night for Stoudemire to regain his       dominance, his rightly place as one of the game's most fierce finishers,       this would be it.
And it didn't happen -- not even close. The powers that are guiding the       Knicks toward whatever inevitable conclusion and offseason of turmoil       they're facing are too much to resist. Anthony went out and put 15       points on the Heat in the first quarter, scoring from anywhere and       everywhere on the floor. He finished with 30 points on 26 shots, 17 more       than Stoudemire.
Stoudemire took one shot in the first quarter, and missed.
He would later assert himself with eight of his 18 points in the fourth,       and this is now considered assertive for Stoudemire, who had restored       the Knicks to respectability -- and now can't find a way to fit in.
He didn't speak with reporters, obviously, on that walk into the chaos       of the loading dock Monday night, so we're left to only speculate on       what made Stoudemire take out that metal box. It isn't working for       Stoudemire in New York now, not with this Knicks team -- not anymore.       Not with Anthony's prolific scoring gifts and his leading-man persona       dominating everything. Not with the coach and the system that had fueled       his entire career both gone. Collateral damage in this Knicks season has       been widespread, and it will be long-lasting.
"It's a tough situation," Anthony said. "Seems like there's always       something happening. Snakebit. At this point, it is what it is."
It's a mess, all of it. Stoudemire's hand, the Knicks' chances in this       series against Miami, and ultimately, Stoudemire and Anthony succeeding       together.
Back home for a new start, indeed. The Knicks have lost their top       defender,Iman Shumpert, and at this       rate, they might not have point guardJeremy Linon the floor again until training camp. Now, Stoudemire has a date with       an X-ray machine Tuesday as the Knicks' bizarre season continues to       collide with agony and disharmony, incredible highs and lows.
This was the low point, you would think.
