Microsoft bets big on Nook e-reader
At Mobile World Congress in 2011 RIM “announced plans to launch two additional BlackBerry 4G PlayBook tablets during the second half of 2011, featuring support for LTE and HSPA+ high speed wide area wireless networks.” Months have passed an nothing has officially been launched. However, there’s been an ample amount of leaked images over the past few months showing the tablet exists.
Earlier today, before the big BlackBerry World 2012 Keynote, a RIM marketing executive took some time to speak to a few people and confirmed some upcoming specs of PlayBook 4G LTE. According to this slide it shows that RIM will be launching pack the 4G LTE PlayBook with an updated 1.5Ghz dual-core processor, NFC (Near Field Communication) and “always connected to email” with highlighting the BlackBerry Mobile Fusion feature. The display is expected to be the same at 7-inches. As for the OS, still rocking OS 2.0 (possibly 2.1).
Nothing was officially announced today at any of the events. Tomorrow is a new day.

Specs smecks.
You only need to worry about having a Quad core if you have an Android.
RIM and Apple both integrate their software and hardware amazingly well that lower end specs can out perform any high end android.

It also says HTML5 and Adobe Flash for uncompromised web browsing.
Looks like BlackBerry is ACTUALLY trying now. Not just passing on another iteration like this one is a little better.. here ya go.

Is this a Playbook 2? Or just a 4G version of the original playbook with the updated GHZ?

It better have a snapdragon S4 processor. A TI Cortex A9 or worse, snapdragon S3 would suck.

I’d prefer a bigger screen. One of the most used application on my tablet is watching videos.
