Pfizer, the world's largest drugmaker, reported first-quarter profit fell 19 percent after revenue from cholesterol pill Lipitor declined because of generic competition. The company trimmed its 2012 forecast after the sale of a unit.
Net income dropped to $1.79 billion (24 cents per share) from a year earlier, New York-based Pfizer said Tuesday in a statement. Earnings excluding one-time items beat by 2 cents the 56-cent average of 19 analysts estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
Investors are focused on the company's drug development pipeline, with regulatory decisions near on Eliquis, a blood thinner being developed with Bristol-Myers Squibb, and the arthritis pill tofacitinib. They're also awaiting more clarity on how Chief Executive Officer Ian Read will divest the animal health unit, scheduled to be announced by July.
"The real news will be the updates on the product pipeline for the company that will be left after the nutrition and animal health units are gone," Erik Gordon, a business professor at theUniversityof Michigan in Ann Arbor, said in an e-mail.
Pfizer said full-year profit will be $1.23 to $1.38 per share, compared with a previous forecast for as much as $1.52. The change was from the sale of the company's nutrition unit, the drugmaker said.
Revenue fell to $15.4 billion from $16.5 billion a year earlier, hurt by a 25 percent drop in sales from its pharmaceutical business because of the loss of U.S. patent protection for Lipitor. The sales loss was made up for with a 7 percent cut to costs, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, part of Read's plan to make the company more efficient.
