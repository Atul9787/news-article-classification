I&#x2019;m one of the millions of smartphone owners addicted to Instagram, the free camera app that makes tweaking and sharing photos miraculously easy. While it&#x2019;s wildly popular and the target of Facebook&#x2019;s $1 billion takeover deal, Instagram isn&#x2019;t the only camera app worth having.
I&#x2019;ve had a chance to test a wide range of Instagram alternatives during choice picture-taking opportunities over the past few months, including my sister&#x2019;s wedding in Hawaii in December and a trip to Lebanon this month.
Of the dozen or so I tested, here are four I find myself using again and again:
•  Photosynth by Microsoft Corp. Free. For iOS only (Apple&#x2019;s iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch).
My favorite among the ones I tried, Photosynth lets you take 360-degree panoramic photos that become interactive on a smartphone or computer screen.
The app guides you as you stand in one place and capture photos in all directions. Then it stitches those images together to create a sphere-like panorama that viewers can scroll around in and zoom in and out.
You can share the panorama on Facebook, Twitter or Photosynth.net.
It takes a bit of practice, and it&#x2019;s not an app I would use every day. But I found that in the right setting &#x2014; such as Roman ruins by the sea in Byblos, near Beirut, or my sister&#x2019;s beach wedding &#x2014; the results can be breathtaking.
• TiltShift Generator by Arts & Mobile. Free for basic features, 99 cents for higher resolution and album upload. For iOS only.
Tilt shift is a camera effect that blurs the edges of a picture, creating an optical illusion that makes everything look miniature.
Instagram has that feature (it&#x2019;s the droplet icon when you are taking or editing a picture). TiltShift Generator gives you more control.
You can control where and how much blurring to produce. You can also determine how much darkening around the corners you want to produce a vignette effect. You can also adjust the saturation, brightness and contrast.
• Hipstamatic by Synthetic LLC. $1.99 for basic features, with 99-cent add-ons to give you more imaging options. For iOS only.
I had a hard time figuring Hipstamatic out, but it&#x2019;s worth the effort.
Unlike most filtering apps, you don&#x2019;t adjust a photo after you&#x2019;ve taken it. Instead, you choose different virtual lenses, flashes and film beforehand, and you can&#x2019;t change the setting after you take the shot.
The app is not very intuitive, the settings are hard to keep track of and the accompanying guide isn&#x2019;t very helpful. But once you get a sense of which virtual lens works best under which conditions, you can create stunning photos.
• PhotoToaster by East Coast Pixels, Inc. Free version called PhotoToaster Jr. Full version costs $1.99 and gives you more choices and control. For iOS and Android devices.
I love the ease of flipping through filters on Instagram until I see one that makes a photo pop, but often I want more control over specific effects.
PhotoToaster lets me do both. You can apply preset filters such as &#x201C;Tuneup,&#x201D; &#x201C;Pro,&#x201D; &#x201C;Happy&#x201D; and &#x201C;Chill.&#x201D; You can also tap a button and have more precise control over exposure, color temperature, light and other settings.
