ConocoPhillips, the world's fourth largest refiner, officially splits in two on Tuesday by spinning off all of its refineries, including in Billings.The Billings refinery will become part of a new company with a familiar name, Phillips 66."We wouldn't expect there to be any significant changes at our local operations except for the changing of the sign," said Rich Johnson, a Phillips 66 spokesman based in Houston.Johnson said the Billings refinery has temporary signs to use, but he didn't know when the permanent sign would go up. Billings is the smallest of the energy company's U.S. refineries and employs 300 people, plus 150 resident contractors.Phillips 66 will handle refining, marketing, chemicals and the pipeline or transportation side of the business. Conoco will keep the oil and gas 
fields and focus on crude oil and natural gas production.Phillips 66 will be the largest independent refiner in the U.S., but this 
split from Conoco is happening as demand for gasoline declines because 
Americans are driving fewer miles.Phillips 66 owns or operates 15 refineries, including 11 in the U.S., and 
is trying to sell a Louisiana refinery, according to an article in Forbes. The 
article said the company's most profitable refiners are located along the 
Rocky Mountains from Montana to Texas.Meanwhile on Monday, a subsidiary of Delta Air Lines purchased a Phillips 66 refinery near Philadelphia. The subsidiary, Monroe Energy LLC, paid Phillips $150 million, including receiving $30 million from the state of 
Pennsylvania for incentive payments. Monroe will invest another $100 million so the Philly plant can produce jet fuel for Delta.The Billings refinery recently changed managers.Julian Stoll, a native of England who has worked for ConocoPhillips since 
1991, took over as manager just as the Billings refinery shut down for routine 
maintenance. The turnaround, or maintenance, project means 1,500 contract 
workers will be working at the refinery until the plant comes back online in a 
couple of weeks.The refinery also is replacing two giant coke drums, a $48 million 
project. Coke drums allow sour crude oil to be processed into diesel, 
gasoline, aviation fuel and other products.In 2002, Conoco merged with Phillips Petroleum Co. Last July, the company 
announced it was reversing that decision, a corporate divorce that is just now 
taking effect.On March 31, ConocoPhillips, which employs nearly 30,000 people and is headquartered in Houston, reported $163 billion in assets. The latest quarterly report shows earnings of $2.9 billion or $2.27 per share, down slightly from $3 billion for the same period last year.Phillips 66 will sell public stock on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol PSX. ConocoPhillips trades on the NYSE under the symbol COP.
