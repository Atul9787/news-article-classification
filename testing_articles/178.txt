Study links Tasers to fatalities, cardiac arrest

On the drive from San Jose to Lucile Packard Children's Hospital on Monday, Ginady Sabuco asked her twin 2-year-old daughters if they missed the closeness they used to share when they were joined at the chest.
"No!" the girls shouted back in unison from their separate car seats.
Six months after their complicated and successful surgery, Angelica and Angelina Sabuco are relishing their independence, no longer walking sideways, sleeping on top of each other or jabbing each other in the neck with their elbows when they raise a fork to their mouths.
"Now the problem their mother has is keeping track of them," said Dr. Gary Hartman, the lead surgeon on the team that operated on the sisters -- his sixth surgery separating conjoined twins. "Now, they're running in opposite directions."
Even photographers attending a news conference at the hospital had difficulty capturing an image of the twins together in their matching pink dresses and sparkling shoes. At one point, Angelica -- the more outgoing twin -- raced toward the double doors, while Angelina -- the quieter one -- hid next to the gift shop.
For their mother, it's nothing but a blessing.
"My angels can now play normally like other kids," Ginady Sabuco said.
But it had taken some time -- and lots of tears -- to come into their own.
After the 10-hour surgery on Nov. 1, Angelina was the first to wake up. Her parents and nurses watched as she reached out her arm andAdvertisementyld_mgr.place_ad_here("adPosBox");stretched her leg, searching for her sister. When nurses wheeled her over to her sister's bed, Angelina started to cry when Angelica -- still sedated -- didn't respond to her touch. Nurses Candace Connell and Lisa Hilldoerfer pushed the beds together.
Night after night, "they kept crying and crying," their mother said.
"They feel like they're both part of the same organism. That's what they've known," Hartman said. "They feel as though they're one person -- two personalities, I can tell you -- but one person."
Those different personalities made it especially difficult for the sisters joined at the chest and abdomen, sharing their livers, diaphragms and breast bones. Before surgery, they constantly fought and grabbed over toys -- and Angelica usually won, her aunt, Marites Sabuco, said. Angelica was the dominant one, even sleeping on top of her sister.
"It was hard for us," said the aunt, who lives with Sabuco family. It was hard for them."
Still, in the early days after the surgery, the girls seemed to miss their intimate connection. Angelina in particular sought out her aunt who sat nearby in a hospital chair.
"She needed closeness," Hilldoerfer said. "Auntie was rolling her into her, rollingher into her chest."
The girls, however, quickly learned the advantages of being on their own.
One of the first things the family noticed when the girls were well enough to sit up by themselves was that they could turn their backs on each other to keep their toys out of sight and out of reach from the other.
Ever since, "they've been nicer to each other," Marites Sabuco said. "They get along better."
And Angelina -- the quiet one -- has become more self-confident.
"She has a really outgoing personality now," the aunt said. "She's talking and engaging."
The doctors involved in the surgery -- Hartman, liver specialist Matias Bruzoni and plastic surgeon Peter Lorenz -- say the girls have had exceptional recoveries, free from infections. Except for some more plastic surgery to better curve their breast plates, no further surgeries are planned. Still, the girls will be monitored as they grow for at least another 10 years.
On Monday, the extended Sabuco family gathered at the hospital to help celebrate the girls' recovery. The twins' father, Fidel Sabuco, a U.S. citizen who emigrated from the Philippines years before the children were born, couldn't attend the news conference. He took enough time off his job as a technician at a medical supply company in the weeks surrounding the surgery.
His insurance, Blue Cross, covered much of the expense of the surgery and aftercare and the Packard Foundation paid the rest, the family said. The hospital declined to release the cost of the surgery.
"We're very thankful to the Lord," said the girls' uncle, Roger Agcanas. "It's a miracle. It's just like nothing happened to them. It's like they had never been conjoined."
