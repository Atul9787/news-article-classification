CHANDLER, Arizona -  Intel's new Arizona factory represents a giant bet that the U.S. can still be a good place to build things. Yet the factory may be less a sign of things to come than the last gasp of a sector that could readily go the way of its low-tech ancestors: to Asia.Full Article

NEW YORK(Reuters Health) - New research suggests that starting breast cancer screening at age 40 might be worthwhile for some women who have a higher-than-average risk of the disease, for example because their mother had cancer.
Researchers and cancer groups don't all agree on when women should begin getting regular mammograms, or how often they should be screened.
According to the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), a federally-funded panel, evidence supports screening average-risk women age 50 to 74 every other year -- but women can decide with their doctors to start earlier based how they weigh screening's risks and benefits.
One in eight U.S. women will developed invasive breast cancer at some point, according to estimates, but less than a quarter of them will die from it.
Mammograms have been shown to help detect tumors early while they're easier to treat, but they also have their downsides. So-called false positives are common and can lead to anxiety, more-invasive testing and even unnecessary treatment, as can over-diagnosis -- when women are treated for small, slow-growing cancers that never would have ended up causing any symptoms.
Screening tests also deliver a small dose of radiation which itself can slightly raise long-term cancer risks.
Two new reports, published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine, suggest those possible harms may be worth it for a group of women in their 40s who are at higher risk of breast cancer to begin with.
In one analysis, researchers led by Dr. Heidi Nelson of Oregon Health & Science University in Portland reviewed 66 studies that determined women's chances of getting breast cancer based on their family history, weight, drinking and smoking habits and whether they had ever given birth or breastfed.
They found having a mom or sister with breast cancer or having very dense breasts, in particular, were each linked to a doubling of a woman's likelihood of getting cancer.
Women whose more distant relatives had breast cancer, or those who had kids after age 30 or not at all, also had a slightly increased risk of cancer.
Being aware of those risks factors may help doctors and patients create a more personalized screening strategy, Nelson and her colleagues concluded.
Another study, based on modeling of screening risks and benefits for different women, follows the same logic.
Researchers found that biennial screening for women in their 40s who have twice the average breast cancer risk because of family history and breast density has the same balance of false-positive risks and life-extending benefits as screening women age 50 to 74, as recommended by the USPSTF.
That analysis was led by Nicolien van Ravesteyn from Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Some researchers, including Nelson and van Ravesteyn, worked on both studies.
Making screening decisions based on a woman's individual cancer risk "has the potential to save more lives than our current practice," Dr. Otis Brawley, Chief Medical Officer at the American Cancer Society, wrote in a commentary accompanying the new reports.
"Risk-based screening can refocus efforts onto the women who are most likely to benefit from screening."
Brawley wrote that in the future, guidelines based on when to start screening and how often mammograms should be done will be more tailored to individuals and their varying cancer risks.
"Ultimately," he concluded, "the preferences of individual women, recognizing the potential for harm and benefit, should be respected."

If the preferences of individual women, recognizing the potential for harm and benefit should be respected then maybe Mammograms may not be worth the risks for any in their 40’s, if given the truth. That truth would not only be the Dangers of Medical Radiation, but the entire truth of diet and dress code, which may have a negative impact on women’s health contributing Breast Cancer.
Doctor’s and Scientist’s have pointed out the significant cumulative risks of radiation from routine mammography and its promotion of breast cancer.
Science has proven Radiation Risks from routine mammography poses significant cumulative risks of initiating and promoting breast cancer. Doctors or scientists’, who promote mammograms as a means of early detection of breast cancer do not support those facts.  Science has also proven there are “False Positives” and “False Negatives”, with twenty percent of women who receive negative results, suggesting they do not have breast cancer, actually do have breast cancer, which mammograms failed to detect.
In July1995, the Medical Journal Lancet wrote, the benefit of Mammograms is marginal, the harm caused is substantial and the costs incurred are enormous.
Many experts warn that the radiation in mammography actually increases the risk of breast cancer. Dr. Russell Blaylock, MD, suggests annual mammography increases the risk of breast cancer by 2% each year. We also have the National Cancer Institute (NCI) suggesting mammography is especially dangerous for younger women, which could cause 75 cases of breast cancer for every 15 it identifies. With those statistics it’s easy to see why the U.S. Government has called for a reduction in mammography, which has increased medical care costs in the U.S. Even Dr. Charles Simone, a former clinical associate in immunology and pharmacology at the NCI, says, “Mammograms increase the risk for developing breast cancer and raise the risk of spreading or metastasizing (the spread of a disease from one organ or part to another non-adjacent organ or part) an existing growth”.
To continue to promote mammograms when the facts are all too clear, that the procedure is a hazard to women’s good health, is to continue to seek profits at all costs.
To all of the women afraid of this monster, Breast Cancer, learn as much as you can about your Lymphatic System and how it works. Be mindful that when a Lymph Node is clogged, that clogged lump could be a false positive and the clogged Lymph Node could be unclogged with proper diet. Just because it’s a lump doesn’t mean its cancer.
To Your Good Health,
John
