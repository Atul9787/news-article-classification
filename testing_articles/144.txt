A study of twins has found that sleeping for less than seven hours a night was 
  linked to higher bodyweights and a greater susceptibility to genetic factors 
  that influence weight.
However the opposite was true in people who slept for nine hours or more.
Several genes have been found to be associated with obesity and this is 
  thought to be the first study to examine how sleep interacts with them.
The genes affect how the body uses energy, how fat is stored, the feeling of 
  being full after a meal and how quickly sugar is used up.
A team at the University of Washington studied 1,088 pairs of twins and found 
  that the genetic influence on their body mass index was twice as great in 
  those who slept for less than seven hours compared to those who slept for 
  nine hours a night.

The findings were published in the journal,Sleep.
Lead author Dr Nathaniel Watson, said: "The results suggest that shorter 
  sleep provides a more permissive environment for the expression of obesity 
  related genes.
"Or it may be that extended sleep is protective by suppressing expression 
  of obesity genes."
Dr Watson said the results were preliminary but may suggest that weight loss 
  measures would be most effective when the genetic influences on obesity were 
  mitigated through sleep extension.
