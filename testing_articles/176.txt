Tasers Pose Risks to Heart, a Study Warns
The conjoined twins who underwent a successful separation surgery six months ago celebrated yesterday at the same hospital where they had the operation.
When Angelica and Angelina Sabuco were born in Philippine, they were joined at the chest and abdomen. After moving to United States, the twins received a separation surgery at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital of Standard University in Palo Alto, Calif. On Nov. 1, 2011, when the twins were two years old, surgeon Dr. Gary Hartman and a team of more than 40 people carried out a 10-hour operation.

Now six months after the separation, the twins came back at the Calif. hospital, appearing healthy and active. Wearing matching pink dresses, Angelina and Angelica came as the guests of honor at a coming out party on Monday, the Associated Press reported.
"They love to run around, go out, and play with other children now," said Ginady Sabuco, the mother of the twins, in the hospital's statement. "We are so grateful to Packard Children's."
"They are so active and they have their own dreams. We were watching American Idol. They said, 'I want to be the next American Idol,'" said the twins' aunt Marites Sabuco in ABC News.
Dr. Hartman said the twins' recovery is right on schedule and everything seems smooth.
The twins still need to visit plastic surgeon because they were implanted a custom-made plate where their sternum should be. According to Dr. Peter Lorenz, who performed the implantation, said the plates will dissolve by this year as the bones fuse.
In August, the twins will celebrate their third birthday, and this time, they will be separate.
"That is a great birthday gift!" said Ginady.
